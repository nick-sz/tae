## About TAE40116 Certificate IV in Training and Assessment

TAE40116 Certificate IV in Training and Assessment is a nationally recognised qualification from the VET sector. To gain any qualification in the VET sector, it is compulsory to follow the packaging rules. Packaging rules refer to two types of units of competency:

-   The core units of competency (can be thought of as subjects) in a qualification which must be completed
-   The elective units of competency, of which the prescribed number must be completed.

Elective units of competency will be selected by you or the RTO, not the student. The packaging rules will determine how many elective units of competency you must complete. The RTO you have chosen to complete this course is TAFE NSW. If you have chosen to complete the entire course with TAFE NSW, you will be completing the following ten units of competency.

**The Design Cluster**

The design cluster includes two units that will introduce you to the underpinning documentation and principles that all of your training and assessment work will depend upon.

| Code          | Title                                                             | Core/elective |

## Your learning journey

The TAFE NSW TAE40116 Certificate IV in Training and Assessment has been designed to be delivered and assessed as “clusters”. Clustering is when related units are grouped together for delivery and assessment. Clustering helps make the assessment activities more streamlined and efficient for students so you aren’t repeating information and questions against multiple units of competency. The clusters in this course are:

-   **The design cluster** – is about designing training programs that meet the needs of your stakeholders
-   **Language, literacy and numeracy unit** – helps you determine support requirements
-   **The delivery cluster** – is about delivering training that meets the needs of your learners
-   **The assessment cluster** - is about planning assessments and assessing your candidates.

Each cluster has several assessment tasks you are required to complete. Your teacher will explain the training and assessment timetables and requirements for each cluster. The assessment load in this course is considerable and it is recommended you implement a strong time management approach to your studies that considers your other commitments, your family’s needs and any other factors that may impact on your studies. It is also required that you familiarise yourself with the Student Handbook (available on Teams) paying particular attention to the Student Rights and Responsibilities and policies regarding extensions and late submission of assessments. A guide to student assessment is also available on Teams for you to review.

## Language

-   Facilitator.

The people being trained/consulted about training:

-   Student
-   Learner
-   Trainee
-   Apprentice
-   Employee
-   Cohort

## Student workbook

The TAE40116 Certificate IV in Training and Assessment Student Workbook has been designed on a topic basis for you to dip into as required; generally directly by your teacher. The Student Workbook includes:

-   Information in a bite-sized, easy to access format.
-   Activities for you to build your skills and knowledge. These activities are aligned to the assessment tasks in each unit.
-   Links for further information.

Your teacher will guide you about which topics and activities are relevant for different portions of the course as your weekly classes may not follow these topics in order. While some students may find this frustrating, this is a decision made by your teacher to present the information in a flow that will be informed by a range of factors including how previous students have responded to information order, the demands of the assessment, reflection of workplace practice, and their own preferences as a teacher. You will come to better appreciate these design decisions as you move through the course and start making these decisions for your own students.

## Face-to-face study

What does studying TAE40116 Certificate IV in Training and Assessment in a virtual TAFE NSW learning environment look like?

**Teacher-directed sessions**

The sessions where you start a new topic will typically involve your teacher closely guiding you and your class members through a series of structured activities or practice opportunities. In these sessions, you could be actively involved in:

-   Demonstrations
-   Practice opportunities
-   Group work
-   Discussions
-   Research
-   Presentations
-   Guest speakers
-   Role-plays
-   Case studies.

    Your teacher will typically refer to these as your classes.

**Student-centred sessions**

In these sessions, you will be given opportunities to work on your assessments. These sessions will typically involve you and your class members working independently to prepare for and complete portions of your assessments and being given guidance from your teacher on the requirements for these tasks. Your teacher will be available to assist you with any questions. Your fellow class members are also a great resource during these sessions. You will still be required to complete a significant amount of assessment work outside of these classes – you will not be able to complete everything within the time allocated to these sessions. Your teacher will typically refer to these as webinars.

**Mandatory assessment sessions**

Your teacher will provide your class a timetable to manage the sessions where you will need to be assessed training or assessing learners or participating in role plays.

In the assessments requiring role plays, these will typically be completed during webinars and completed in small groups running concurrently in different breakout group rooms. They will be recorded so the assessor can review your work. It is a mandatory component of the course that you both complete the role play and act in different roles for your peers.

In the assessments requiring delivery, only one student in your class can be assessed at a time. This student will need other learners, up to eight learners for some assessments, to act as the “learner” being trained or assessed. It is expected that students help each other out by acting as the “learner” or “candidate” so that other students can be assessed as the trainer or assessor. However, some students may choose to supply their own learners, or deliver and record their session offsite and send it to their teacher to be assessed. Your teacher will advise the specific logistics ahead of these sessions.

In the assessments requiring you to assess others, these will be conducted during class time in breakout groups. They will be recorded so the assessor can review your work. It is a mandatory component of the course that you both complete the assessment and act in different roles for your peers.

At different points, as participants in other students’ assessments, you will be required to provide documentation such as feedback forms. Please ensure you provide these immediately at the conclusion of the role play. It is unacceptable to disadvantage your peers by not providing this paperwork.

## Tips for success

To complete TAE40116 Certificate IV in Training and Assessment, you need to be motivated, independent, and organised.

Your responsibilities include:

-   Attending and actively participating in every session. Consider your attendance at class as you would attendance at work
-   Asking questions to confirm what is required in activities/assessment events. It is expected that you participate in all breakout group discussions and activities and contribute multiple times per class to whole group discussions. In class contribution of your views and experience are valuable to your peers and allow your teacher to ensure you are developing an accurate understanding. You are training to lead educational settings; therefore it is expected you actively contribute to discussions and share of your experiences
-   Please communicate with your peers and your teachers professionally. Consider both written and verbal communications. Manage, engage with, and respond to all incoming information in a timely manner.
-   There is no element of competition in this class. Take the opportunity to help your peers out and be part of a positive learning team. Maybe the peer you help out tomorrow is the one who recommends you for a job next year.
-   Ensure you are professional in your personal presentation, whether on screen or in a classroom
-   Submitting professional assessments that meet industry standards by the advertised dates. Ensure all your work is professionally presented – if you need to invest in your digital literacy skills, there is plenty of support to help with this. Achieving this standard may require you to stretch these skills.
-   You will need to request an extension and provide a valid reason. Where you miss an assessment event, your will be required to provide the assessment conditions required for that event.
-   You can resubmit an assessment where corrections are required. Any further resubmissions will not be permitted without good cause.
-   Where you haven’t passed an assessment, another teacher will review your work before a Not Competent result is recorded and you will need to repeat the unit or cluster

## Tips for success in a virtual classroom

For most students, this will be the first time studying in a virtual classroom and there are some unique challenges that you may not have anticipated.

It is important to consider other students, even though they aren’t in the same room as you. Keeping your camera on is expected as it allows your teacher and your peers to build a stronger relationship with you – if you are prone to distraction, it may also help keep you focused. There may be short periods of time when you need to turn your camera off but keep these short.

Depending on the size of the class, you teacher may require you to keep your microphone on or off. For smaller classes, it will be microphone on to encourage more natural discussion and interaction, for larger classes it will be microphone off to avoid too much background noise.

Your teacher will advise you if sessions are to be recorded. Depending on where you are studying, you may find there are different background distractions to being in a classroom. You can use these recordings to review parts of the lesson, but they are not to be considered a substitute for attending class. Much of the rich learning will take place in breakout groups and these are not recorded. It can be helpful to take time stamps of different points of the class against the slides that are made available on Teams.

How you manage your information and files will be an important factor in your success in this course. For example, one assessment task will require you to keep track of up to 53 separate documents! Getting organised and maintaining good digital hygiene is critical.

-   Pay close attention to file naming conventions and version control. This is critical in RTOs and we are training you to best practice. Your teacher will advise you of the naming convention they wish you to use for your assessments. Assessments will not be accepted if you don’t follow these conventions.
-   Use your TAFE email address for all correspondence with your teachers and your peers. You can set up your devices to receive emails from this account.
-   Use your TAFE NSW Onedrive for all your TAFE work. **This is a mandatory part of your course** and is assessed at different stages throughout. Set up folders and practice good digital hygiene. Save all your files, including any recordings you need to make, in the folders in which they belong. Using the suggested folder structure below, you would save your qualification documents such as this workbook, your student handbook etc in the folder 1. TAE40116, documents related to the Deign cluster such as your Unit Assessment Guide in the folder 1. Design, and documents relating to each of your assessment events in their respective folders:

    ![](media/ad327ca102c3ce3a0fd3178a8d2e3fde.png)

-   Familiarise yourself with the Teams site and know how to access the documents and resources that have been provided to you. You will be expected to access these as you need them. Initially you may find the site intimidating and daunting, but you will become more familiar with it over time. If you think the way you are using something or accessing something feels clunky, ask your peers how they are doing it – there are multiple ways to navigate, and they might have a better way of doing things.

## Final tip

As a final tip for succeeding in the VET industry, take every opportunity to showcase your work ethic, talents and skills while undertaking your TAE40116. Your teachers and assessors have spent years developing their training and assessment skills in a variety of fields. They can provide tips and suggestions to create industry contacts and strategies and gain experience training and assessing in the VET industry. Proactively help your peers – teaching someone else is always a very valuable learning activity.

# Introduction to the Design Cluster

Welcome to your first cluster in yourTAE40116 Certificate IV in Training and Assessment – the design cluster.

In this cluster you will be covering two units of competency:

-   TAEDES401 - Design and develop learning programs (Release 2)
-   TAEDES402 - Use training packages and accredited courses to meet client needs (Release 2)

    You will cover several foundational areas of content that will be important throughout your course:

-   Competency-based training
-   Training products used in vocational education and training (VET) including Training packages, qualifications, units of competency, skill sets, accredited courses
-   Stakeholders, frameworks and regulatory tools that support quality in VET
-   Theories and principles of effective learning design
-   The processes and considerations required when designing and developing a learning program.

# Competency-based training

The Vocational Education and Training (VET) system within Australia is based on the approach of competency-based training. Competency-based training is focused on ensuring students can perform the skills and knowledge required of a capable employee into a particular job, role, or industry. When a student is able to demonstrate that they can perform the skills and knowledge to industry standards, they are considered “Competent”.

This focus on competency reflects the role of VET in the broader Australian economy. All aspects of VET are about producing workers. While there is a lot to be said about the intrinsic value of education and the social and personal benefits, within the VET sector these are secondary concerns and benefits to the impacts of producing high quality employees for industry.

Your will hear “industry” discussed a lot throughout this qualification and during your career. A constant concern at a policy level is ensuring closer relationships between VET and industry, making sure the training provided by VET meets the needs of industry. You can consider “industry” as the collection of employers, organisations, professionals, experts, researchers, advisory and regulatory groups, customers, and other stakeholders who influence how a particular vocation operates. It may reference a job role such as Management and Administration, or it may reference an organisation’s focus such as the Seafood Industry.

Because of this relationship to industry, VET has a critical economic role to play. By producing high quality graduates, who can perform highly in their roles, we are able to improve the productivity, quality, and efficiency of all aspects of work throughout Australia. There are few areas of the economy that aren’t influenced by the quality of VET. That is why it is so important that we produce the best possible teachers and why this course is so rigorous – we are producing all the teachers that will produce all the workers.

Emphasising the need for students to be able to meet workplace and industry standards means that there are two key aspects of a student’s performance that we are interested in: **skills and knowledge**. The skills of a student refers to what a student can do. Skills may be performing a series of steps using tools and materials such as making a cup of coffee, or they may be cognitive based such as developing a budget. The knowledge refers to the underpinning information a student needs to be able to perform those skills. Knowledge may refer to theories, explanations of how things work, familiarity with legislation or other concepts.

Strict definitions of competency will also consider attitude as a component of competency. However, attitude can be difficult and expensive to evaluate, so it tends to be expressed in terms of behaviour and skills in those areas where attitude is important such as customer service, nursing, and early education etc.

This interest in skills and knowledge means that there needs to be a way to determine whether students are performing skills well enough and know what they need to know to consistently perform as well as industry expects them to. This means there needs to be a performance standard that students can be measured against. Within VET, all RTOs use the same performance standards – referred to as units of competency that cover a specific workplace task, however organisations and internal Learning and Development (L&D) departments may use other standards such as operating procedures, job descriptions or procedures.

Competency-based training is agnostic about where or how students acquire the required skills and knowledge – so long as they have them and are able to consistently perform according to the student. So, if a student already has some of the required knowledge that they learnt in a different field through prior experience or by previous studies, even if they taught themselves, VET recognises that knowledge and doesn’t “re-teach”. This can be complex in practical terms in a class with students all having different experiences, but that is the starting assumption. It is the assumption that gives rise to the processes around recognition of prior learning and recognition of current competence – recognising that if a student has already learnt something and can demonstrate performance against the standard, we don’t require them to “re-learn” it, rather it focusses on the student building on their existing skills and knowledge. It is essential that the student needs to be able to demonstrate or provide evidence of their pre-existing skills and knowledge which in some contexts can be difficult to do.

Competency-based training is interested in the skills and knowledge of the individual student. Therefore, it doesn’t have a ranking component to it as all students are compared individually to the performance standard. A learner’s achievement is never assessed relative to others.

Being outcomes focussed, there is no regulated prescription as to how a student should be trained, how long it must take or what the student must do to progress through a learning journey. These are decisions that rest with the RTO and the trainer and will be made based on the needs of the students and the needs of the local employers.

# Training packages and qualifications

Training packages are a set of nationally endorsed standards (competency units) required by individuals to perform their work effectively. They also detail how individual units of competency can be packaged into qualifications that align to the AQF. Training packages are used to recognise, train and assess the skills and knowledge people need to perform in the workplace. They are used to:

-   Assist employees with workforce design, development, and structure
-   Design training courses (curriculum and syllabus) that can be tailored to support individual student, employer and industry needs.

## What is the function of a training package?

Training packages are designed to standardise training across RTOs by expressing the needs of industry and ensuring demands for a skills are met to an agreed quality. They contain information about nationally recognised qualifications and the units that make up each qualification via the packaging rules. Through the packaging rules, training packages outline how units can be put together to complete a qualification that reflects the needs of industry and the Australian Qualifications Framework. Competency-based VET training and assessment systems use training packages as performance benchmarks via the units of competency that they contain.

They are a set of nationally endorsed standards and these standards are the requirements (ie skills and knowledge) that individuals required to perform their work effectively.

Training packages are developed by the Industry Reference Committees (IRC), Skills Services Organisations (SSO) and government agencies[^4].

[^4]: <https://www.asqa.gov.au/about/vet-sector/training-packages>

When developing learning programs, you would use training packages to:

-   Assist employees with workforce design, development, and structure
-   Encourage learning in the workplace
-   Design training courses that can be tailored to support individual student, employer and industry needs
-   Help employees meet nationally recognised standards of competences

Each training package represents a different industry. Examples of training packages are:

-   MEA Aeroskills
-   ACM Animal Care and Management
-   SHB Hairdressing and Beauty
-   TAE Training and Assessment.

![Training Packages contain AQF qualifications which include competency units (standards)](media/9ee98e80fa2aa1e0c2d6e89a5ff3b1ff.png)

© TAFE NSW 2019

Training packages document qualifications. Qualifications describe the skills and knowledge you need to perform different jobs in that industry. For example:

**Training Package**: Animal Care and Management

**Qualifications:**

-   Certificate III in Farriery
-   Diploma of Veterinary Nursing (Emergency and Critical Care)

The qualifications are available at different skill and knowledge levels such as Certificate II, or Diploma.

Training packages also contain skill sets. Skill sets are either a single unit of competency or a collection of units of competency that link to a licence or regulatory requirement, or defined industry need. Skill sets often reflect niche areas of the industry reflected in that training package

Each qualification contains many units of competency. Units of competency describe tasks in a job role. For example, Certificate IV in Training and Assessment includes the units:

-   TAEDES401 Design and develop learning programs
-   TAEASS402 Assess competence.

    There are three key parts of a training package:

-   Qualifications and Skill Sets
-   Units of Competency
-   Assessment Guidelines and Requirements

## Standards for training packages

[Standards for training packages](https://docs.education.gov.au/node/37157)[^5] give a consistent design for training packages, ensuring their quality. It ensures training packages are of a high quality and meet the demands of industry, enterprises and individuals.

[^5]: <https://docs.education.gov.au/node/37157>

Training packages will have a three letter code. Refer back to the example training packages given on page 23 and note the codes at the front of their titles. When referring to a specific training package, always include the code. In the past, training package codes used to include the year of release, eg TAE10 referred to the Training and Assessment training package released in 2010, however these year codes have since been dropped. If you think your training package still includes the year, you should bring it to the attention of your teacher.

Each training package must contain the four endorsed components of a training package and supply a companion volume.

![](media/35841715a1f612bd406ebbfd5b2b8f80.png)

© TAFE NSW 2019

While many training packages conform to these standards there is still some variation in their presentation, language, coding and structure. Often these variations reflect industry needs such as long standing licensing or award structures. The MEM Manufacturing and Engineering training package is one example where this variation can be seen.

## Endorsed and non-endorsed components

When training and assessment leads to AQF qualifications and Statements of Attainment (nationally recognised training), the **endorsed components** of a training package must be followed and will be subject to audit.

**Unit of Competency standards:** Each unit of competency covers a workplace task and includes the knowledge and skills required to be competent. They set a standard for performance in the workplace.

**Assessment requirements:** The assessment requirements provide an industry framework to ensure all assessments meet industry needs and nationally agreed standards. They specify the evidence and required conditions for assessment.

**Qualification:** Each training package provides details of those units of competency that must be achieved to award AQF qualifications. Each qualification will have an identified AQF level associated with it. The rules around which units of competency can be combined to make up a valid AQF qualification in the training package are referred to as the ‘packaging rules’.

**Credit arrangements:** The structure of national VET qualifications means units of competency already studied can count as credit towards other qualifications**.** The credit arrangement section specifies existing credit arrangements (recognition) between training packages and higher education qualifications in accordance with the AQF.

The support materials, or resources, that help design and deliver training and assessment are non-endorsed components of a training package. Training support materials may include:

-   Companion volumes, which are sometimes referred to as implementation guides. At least one must be produced for every training package.
-   Assessor resources, for example, those that assist with assessment
-   Student workbooks or trainer resources
-   Facilitator/User guides, which provide information about specific components
-   Skill sets, which are groups of endorsed units that link to a licensing or regulatory requirement or a defined industry need (TAE Training and Education Implementation Guide).

## Accessing training packages

Training packages and their associated products including skills sets, qualifications and units of competency are stored on the training.gov.au website and are free for anyone to access via the VET National Register.

To access the VET National Register and to locate a training package go to [training.gov.au homepage](https://training.gov.au/Home/Tga)[^6]

## Training package updates

Keeping up to date with changes to training package qualifications, units of competency or accredited courses is important to ensure you are working within the rules for RTOs. You must deliver from the **current** UOC and Qualification. If you don’t, this could have consequences for learners. For example The most current WHS certificate and you deliver the call then it will be obsolete possibly find work.

## Structure of a qualification

Qualifications have the following structure.

| Field name                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Qualification code, name and release number | Identifies the qualification by code and name and indicates the version (release)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Modification history                        | Gives information on the release of the qualification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Qualification Description                   | Indicates roles the qualification reflects and the volume of learning.  It will include if there are licensing/regulatory requirements.  For example, in TAE40116 under licensing, it has ‘Achievement of this qualification by trainers is a requirement of the Standards for Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) 2015’. |
| Licensing/Regulatory Information            | In some instances, qualifications will contribute to a licencing or regulatory requirements. This information will be important to consider when developing assessment tools. TAE40116 Certificate IV in Training and Assessment is one such example                                                                           |
| Entry requirements                          | Outlines what a learner must have to commence the qualification. For example, for TAE40116 ‘Those entering this program must be able to demonstrate vocational competency in their proposed teaching and assessing area’.                                                                                                      |
| Packaging rules                             | This indicates the amount of core (mandatory) and elective (choose from a list) units required to successfully complete the qualification. For example, for TAE40116 there are 9 core units and 1 elective unit.                                                                                                               |
| Qualification mapping information           | Demonstrates the difference between similar qualifications and whether there is equivalency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Links                                       | Provides links to the mandatory non-endorsed companion volume, which may be called an implementation guide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Qualification codebreaking

The code of the training packages can reveal a lot about the qualification.

![TAE 4 01 16 - The first three letters are the Training Package identifier. The first number is the AQF level. The third and fourth numbers are the qualification sequence in the TP. The fifth and sixth numbers are the year the TP was endorsed.](media/1da542ca2779dec210c1140e9b91b593.png)

© TAFE NSW 2019

The vast majority of qualification codes will conform to this pattern, but not all. If you find a qualification that has a code with a different format, bring it to the attention of your teacher.

Qualification titles should always be written in title case and must include the code. For example: AHC30921 - Certificate III in Landscape Construction (Release 1). It is good practice to include the release. *Note that each significant word is capitalised.*

# Units of competency

A trainer and/or assessor who work for an RTO require skills in analysing units of competency. You could think of each unit of competency as a ‘topic’ or ‘subject’. They are the ‘building blocks’ that make up a qualification in a training package. Each unit of competency will relate to a specific job task and sets the performance standard agreed with industry for that particular task.

All nationally recognised units of competency are on the National Register of VET. To find a unit of competency go to [training.gov.au](http://www.training.gov.au).[^7]

[^7]: <https://training.gov.au/Home/Tga>

Type the unit of competency code in the search box and click the search button. You can also search for the training package or qualification and use the hyperlinks in those training products to identify the unit you are looking for.

Select the unit code of the current unit. The currency of the unit is given in the *Usage* recommendation. Do not use superseded units.

You can view the unit on screen or download the unit of competency and assessment requirements. Make sure you read both the unit of competency and the assessment requirements. They are available as a word document or PDF.

![](media/8cba28463e162528116cde0313196ae3.png)

Source: <https://training.gov.au/Home/Tga>

Units of competency titles should always be written in sentence case and must include the code. For example: AHCPCM303 - Identify plant specimens (Release 2). It is good practice to include the release. Note that only the first word is capitalised.

Units of competency will typically have two documents associated with them:

## Analysing units of competency

When working with units of competency you will need to read and examine them closely, paying particular attention to the elements, performance criteria and assessment requirements.

Units of competency area analysed in detail to:

-   Select units which are relevant to the stakeholders
-   Ensure training addresses all requirements of the unit of competency in preparation for assessment
-   Ensure all aspects of the unit of competency are assessed in the assessment.

You should develop your own procedures for identifying, selecting, and processing information about units of competency. Different approaches are to read the entire document through and then re-read emphasising:

-   Verbs that require the student to do so
-   The sequence of tasks the student would need to perform as part of a process
-   The themes of each part of the unit of competency
-   How the unit reflects any learning or teaching resources you have been provided with

Many units of competency have overlapping information or logically follow on from each other. For example:

**Units:**

-   TAEDES401 Design and develop learning programs
-   TAEDES402 Use training packages and accredited courses to meet client needs both require

**Overlap**: Knowledge of training packages.

**Approach**: Train and assess these units together.

This is referred to as clustering. Instead of repeating the training or assessing for the same component twice, it is delivered and assessed holistically.

To identify whether units are suitable to be clustered, consider how you might go about training or assessing these units. If they have similar themes, cover sequential steps in a process of cover the same skill in different contexts, then they might be suitable to be clustered together.

Alternatively, your analysis of the units may highlight to you that while they should eb delivered separately, there is a clear choice of one unit proceeding another in order to scaffold students as they build more complex skills or progress through different stages of a learning journey.

Units of competency can also be used to inform the segmenting of your training content into specific outcomes for each session, using the elements as a list of the total outcomes that need to be achieved by the training.

## Case study

Crystal teaches plumbing from the Construction, Plumbing and Services Training Package.

Before delivering the qualification, she reviews the units of competency and discovers:

-   A specific unit on work health and safety
-   Most units have a work health and safety component.

Crystal realises delivering the units individually will mean a lot of repetition. She looks for ways she can cluster the units.

Crystal decides to mostly deliver WHS in the practical activities for each unit by having the learners:

-   Undertake a risk assessment before each practical
-   Follow procedures and use personal protective clothing and equipment (PPCE).

## Unit of competency codebreaking

The unit code is the method of identification used to place the unit within the Training Package and the vocational education and training (VET) sector. Each unit of competency has a unique code, which provides information regarding the unit of competency outlined in the following diagram:

Some units, particularly in the CHC training package will have a 0 for the AQF level in unit of competency codes. This signifies that this unit can be used at multiple AQF levels and should be trained and assessed according to the AQF level of the qualification.

## From Training Packages to Learning Programs

Training packages inform qualifications.

The qualification or accredited course will inform the **learning strategy which will include the** design, units, duration, structure and delivery methods. The learning strategy must meet the Standards for RTOs and satisfy the demands of the units of competency selected to comprise that qualification or accredited course. The learning program describes the way the learning strategy will be implemented

The units of competency will establish the **learning program** and curriculum (learning outcomes, standards, content, activities, resources and assessment approaches).

The curriculum will be translated into a delivery plan (full program) and session plans (individual lessons).

| According to the knowledge evidence, what principles must the candidate describe?    |                                         |

# Skill sets

A skill set is a single unit of competency or combination of units of competency from one or more training packages that link to a licence or regulatory requirement, or defined industry need. Skill sets enable performance of job tasks or functions. By comparison, whole qualifications produce learning outcomes that enable performance of a whole VET occupation.

Within training.gov.au, you will find several skill sets associated with each training package. These skill sets have been developed in consultation with industry where specific niche skills have been identified and a suggested combination of units of competency have been identified to meet these needs.

The skill sets available within the TAE Training and Assessment training package are below. You can see that there is that specifically address the skills required to be an assessor (TAESS00019), and one that specifically looks at the skills for online delivery and assessment (TAESS00023).

![](media/e0dac92d667404e11657f49914b41712.png)

However, where an RTO identifies an industry need that isn’t covered by these skill sets, they are able to build their own. You are not confined by the unit combinations that appear on training.gov.au. This means you can combine units from different qualifications, different training packages and different AQF levels to meet identified needs. For example, if there was a need to improve skills in Microsoft Excel, you could combine the units that deal with spreadsheets at AQF level 2, 3 and 4 from the BSB Business Services training package and build a skill set that takes students from rudimentary Excel skills to advanced skill levels.

Skill sets benefit students by giving them:

-   training pathways to AQF qualifications through credit processes
-   specific skills and general capabilities
-   more career opportunities within their workplace and between employers.

    When successfully completed, a student is issued with a Statement of Attainment. This document does not confer a qualification but does document the unit outcomes the student has achieved.

    Skill sets themselves are non-endorsed components of training packages, however, they consist of endorsed units of competency. They use a standard format.

# Accredited courses

Accredited courses address skill requirements for industry, enterprises and the community where these are not covered in nationally endorsed training packages. Accreditation means the formal recognition of a course by a course accrediting body, typically ASQA. Upon accreditation, the course will be given a code that typically begins with three letters indicating the accrediting body (VIC for Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority or NAT for ASQA).

This means that the course:

-   Meets industry, enterprise or community needs and has been developed with strong industry consultation
-   Provides appropriate competency outcomes and a satisfactory basis for assessment
-   Meets national quality assurance requirements
-   Does not duplicate training products already available on the national register
-   Is aligned to the appropriate level of the Australian Qualifications Framework and leads to a qualification
-   Be subject to ongoing and systematic review and evaluation to ensure the course meets its stated objectives

There is a [standard for VET accredited courses](https://www.asqa.gov.au/sites/g/files/net3521/f/Users_guide_to_the_Standards_for_VET_Accredited_Courses.pdf)[^8]. The accredited course documentation follows the guidelines for developing training packages and can be unpacked in the same manner as a training package to provide the basis for the development of strategies for training and assessment. It also describes:

[^8]: [https://www.asqa.gov.au/sites/g/files/net3521/f/Users_guide_to_the_Standards_‌for_VET_Accredited_Courses.pdf](https://www.asqa.gov.au/sites/g/files/net3521/f/Users_guide_to_the_Standards_for_VET_Accredited_Courses.pdf)

    <https://www.asqa.gov.au/standards-vac/course-design-overview>

    <https://www.asqa.gov.au/standards-vac/document-template>

-   The mandatory course rules
-   Entry requirements
-   Outcomes to be achieved
-   Standards for assessment
-   Required resources.

The structure and format of an accredited course contains:

| Section                                                         | What it contains                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Section 1** - Copyright and course classification information | Information about copyright, course classification and type of application i.e. initial accreditation or renewal of accreditation.                                                             |
| **Section 2**: Course information                               | Details of the course purpose, outcomes, structure, entry and delivery requirements, assessment strategies, mapping information to the previous course (if applicable) and credit information. |
| **Section 3:** Units of competency                              | The units of competency developed as part of the course are included in the course document.                                                                                                   |

From an RTO perspective, accreditation means a course may be eligible for:

-   Listing on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS)
-   Enabling marketing and delivery to international students
-   Participant/employer financial assistance through various government programs and relief from GST on courses.

There may also be a need to accredit a course so that participants in the course are eligible for a government or other entitlement. In some industries, accreditation of a course may be a requirement for an RTO to obtain insurance for delivery of the course, or for a graduate to obtain an occupational licensing outcome.

Developing accredited courses that meet these quality standards represents a significant investment of time and money by the course developer and are covered by copyright. Limited detail can be found about accredited courses on the [training.gov.au](https://training.gov.au/) site to protect the intellectual property of the developer. Entities wishing to deliver an accredited course should approach the owners indicated on training.gov.au for more details about eh licensing of the course.

An accredited course is nationally recognised. An RTO can issue a nationally recognised qualification or Statement of Attainment following the completion of an accredited course. These courses can not be delivered by entities who do not hold a license or who are not an RTO.

## Accredited modules

Accredited courses are based on nationally endorsed units of competency, and where these are not available, the course is based on modules. A module is the accredited version of a unit of competency.

An accredited module is:

-   Usually developed for niche areas or skills of industry, enterprise or community needs
-   Developed in consultation with, and validated by, appropriate industry, enterprise, community and/or professional groups
-   Documented in accordance with agreed specifications and requirements.

Consultations must also take place with the IRCs and SSOs to ensure the module is not a duplicate by title or coverage, the outcomes of an endorsed training package qualification.

# Companion Volume Implementation Guides

For each training package, there will be a Companion Volume Implementation Guide. These are non-endorsed documents that offer guidance on how a training package and its included training products can be used effectively by RTOs.

Companion Volume Implementation Guides (CVIG) will vary from training package to training package with some being more useful and detailed than others. The CVIG will give you detailed information about:

-   information relevant to all training packages
-   lists of qualifications, skill sets and units of competency
-   mapping information for qualifications, skill sets and units of competency
-   specific information and advice about the history, structure, key features and application of the Training Package.

    Links to the relevant CVIG will be available as a download on every training product page on training.gov.au.

    ![](media/6a9724e480c3adb6c0ef368566ceb881.png)

    The information in the CVIG is not only useful when developing a learning program but will also be a useful component of the training package when designing and developing assessment tools.

# Dimensions of competency

Training and assessing whether a student can just do the task is not sufficient. Workplace tasks do not occur in isolation and are impacted by the environment in which they take place. The dimensions of competency capture the complexity of performing a task in a workplace environment as this is the environment that will be relevant to the standard of performance. To competently and efficiently perform a task, a person needs:

-   **Task skills:** Performing the actual skill described in the competency at an acceptable level.
-   **Task management skills:** Being able to managing a number of different tasks while performing the skill. Typically this involves time management, prioritising and sequencing.
-   **Contingency management skills:** Responding appropriately when things go wrong or unexpected events occur. Essentially, having a “Plan B” and knowing how to respond.
-   **Job/role environment skills**: Fulfilling the responsibilities and expectations of the workplace. This includes any legal obligations and organisational policies and procedures for example performing the skill whilst maintaining expected standards of customer service.

A person who has these dimensions of competency will be able to transfer their skills and knowledge and apply them in different workplace contexts.

# Training product stakeholders

There are several stakeholders who play a role in developing training products and making them available to the VET industry. All training products are updated regularly as industry needs and their competitive landscapes evolve and change. The key stakeholders include:

-   Industry Reference Committees
-   Skill Service Organisations
-   Australian Industry Skills Committee
-   Australian Skills Quality Authority

**Industry Reference Committees (IRCs):** are responsible for reviewing training products and advising industry needs to inform the development work of SSOs. TIRCs are responsible for:

-   Identifying industry’s skills needs and developing a business case for the need for change or new training package
-   Research and gather information regarding industry trends and changing industry needs and feed this information through to the SSO
-   Advise AISC about skills requirements
-   Directing the work of SSOs to ensure training products contain the correct content
-   Signing off for all proposals, changes, endorsements, business cases, and any other submissions for considerations by the AISC
-   Reporting to AISC on the progress of their work, especially training product content
-   Promoting the use of VET in the industry sectors they represent and contribute to the quality of VET products in their industry

    <https://ibsa.org.au/info-about-industry-reference-committees/>

    <https://www.aisc.net.au/irc/industry-reference-committees>

**Skill Service Organisations (SSO)**: are funded by the Australian Government. Each SSO supports a number of IRC. They are independent professional service organisations and undertake training product development and review that are commissioned by the AISC. They:

-   Support the IRC by facilitating engagement between industry, employers and other stakeholders to identify the skills required for jobs.
-   Drive the training product development and review to ensure the skill requirements and competencies align with contemporary work practices
-   Prepare skills forecasts and documentation relevant to developing and reviewing training packages
-   Draft and develop training products
-   Provide independent professional services such as project management, technical writing, and secretariat support to IRCs
-   Manage the training package endorsement process on behalf of the IRCs.

    <https://www.aisc.net.au/irc/skills-service-organisations>

**Australian Industry and Skills Committee (AISC):** is an industry-led body, which gives industry a formal and expanded role in VET policy direction and decision making. Until late 2022 they also had the authority in the training product development process to approve industry defined training products for implementation/endorsement. As such they are responsible for the quality of training product development nationally. This responsibility is now performed by ASQA on a trial basis. <https://www.aisc.net.au/>

Membership of AISC is comprised of members from industry from all States, Territories, and New Zealand. The AISC is supported by Industry Reference Committees (IRC). They provide advice to government on the quality, relevance and responsiveness of the VET sector. They are also responsible for ensuring the VET sector responds to critical workforce and skills needs.

**Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA)[^9] :** is the national regulator for vocational education and training. They are responsible for registering training providers and accredit VET courses to ensure nationally approved standards are met. Where they find standards have not been met, they are able to take regulatory action that at its most extreme can see an RTO deregistered. They are also responsible for endorsing accredited courses. <https://www.asqa.gov.au/>

[^9]: <https://www.asqa.gov.au/about/asqa/our-role>

They are not responsible for the development of training products, only the recommendation for endorsement. They are also not responsible for facilitating the relationship between industry and VET.

# VET Quality Framework

The vocational education and training (VET) Quality Framework is aimed at achieving greater national consistency in the way RTOs are registered and monitored and in how standards in the vocational education and training (VET) sector are enforced.

The [VET Quality Framework](https://www.asqa.gov.au/about/australias-vet-sector/vet-quality-framework)[^10]comprises:

[^10]: <https://www.asqa.gov.au/about/australias-vet-sector/vet-quality-framework>

-   the Standards for Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) 2015 - standards to ensure nationally consistent, high-quality training and assessment across Australia's VET system
-   the Fit and Proper Person Requirements - which specify the suitability requirements of individuals involved in the operation of a registered training organisation. An RTO must meet the *Fit and Proper Person* requirements 2011 as this is a requirement of registration with ASQA. If ASQA is not satisfied that an organisation or relevant people associated with it, meet the Fit and Proper Person requirements, ASQA may impose a sanction, including cancellation, on the organisation’s registration as an RTO or refuse the organisations initial application to become an RTO
-   the Financial Viability Risk Assessment Requirements - which relate to training organisations' ability to meet financial viability requirements
-   the Data Provision Requirements - which sets out the requirement for providers to supply ASQA with data upon request, and to submit quality indicator data annually
-   the Australian Qualifications Framework - which is the national policy for regulated qualifications in Australian education and training.

All aspects of the VET Quality framework are aimed to ensuring students are protected and industry needs are being met.

# Australian Qualification Framework

The AQF ‘is the national policy for regulated qualifications in Australian education and training[^11]’. It is a single framework for all educational sectors. It:

-   Includes secondary school certification, vocational education and degree qualifications
-   Supports lifelong learning by providing pathways of learning between the different education and training sectors
-   Provides the standards for Australian qualifications. Trainers and assessors use the AQF to determine the level of knowledge and skills required for their nationally recognised courses.

The definition of the levels in the AQF is the same regardless of what industry the qualification is from.

Each level in the AQF has different qualification types:

-   Level 1 – Certificate 1
-   Level 2 – Certificate II
-   Level 3 – Certificate III
-   Level 4 – Certificate IV
-   Level 5 – Diploma
-   Level 6 – Advanced Diploma or Associate Degree
-   Level 7 – Bachelor Degree
-   Level 8 – Bachelor Honours Degree, Graduate Certificate, Graduate Diploma
-   Level 9 – Masters Degree
-   Level 10 – Doctoral Degree

Each AQF level will have a description of the purpose, skills, knowledge and application and increase in level of complexity.

Each AQF level also contains the volume of learning. The volume of learning gives an indication of the duration of all activities required to achieve the learning outcome associated with each AQF level.

Where a qualification is issued under the AQF, it must carry the words “This qualification is recognised within the Australian Qualifications Framework”.

The AQF should be consulted during training and assessment to:

-   Estimate the timeframe required for the learning program
-   Check the depth of knowledge and skills required.

    Review AQF 2nd ed available on your teams site. It is a lengthy document so don’t read all of it, but familiarise yourself with the structure and pay closer attention to pages 1-19.

## Case study

Sarah has been teaching business qualifications of an AQF level 1 and 2 for a number of years. The RTO she works for now would like Sarah to teach business qualifications for AQF level 4. She will also be required to develop assessments at the AQF 4 level. To keep the integrity of the qualifications, Sarah knows she must become familiar with the different level of knowledge and skills at the higher level. She is also aware of the degree of structure, autonomy and responsibility at the higher levels are different to the AQF level 1 and 2 she has been teaching.

Sarah goes to the AQF website and compares the different AQF levels and makes notes on how this might impact the training and assessing.

# VET standards

## Standards for RTOs 2015

RTOs must comply with the Standards for RTOs 2015. As the front line of your training organisation, it is important you understand your responsibilities regarding implementing the Standards for RTOs 2015 .

Both the Standards and the [User’s Guide to the Standards](https://www.asqa.gov.au/standards) can be downloaded from the internet. The user guide gives practical examples of how to interpret the Standards. You can get the [full legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2019C00503) here and scroll down to Part 2 and 3 – Training and assessment.

As a trainer and assessor, the following standards are particularly important:

**Standard 1. The RTO’s training and assessment strategies and practices are responsive to industry and student needs and meet the requirements of training packages and VET accredited courses**

This standard means the trainer must:

-   Select strategies that are suitable for the learners, taking into consideration the students’ skills, knowledge and experience
-   Ensure the course is of an appropriate duration with enough learning and assessment activities for a student to achieve competency. The Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) will give you an indication of an acceptable duration for different qualification levels. The characteristics of your learners will determine whether they require a longer or shorter learning timeframe
-   Deliver training and assessment relevant to industry
-   Identify the needs of students and provide support where required
-   Comply with the assessment requirements of the training package and meet the Principles of Assessment and Rules of Evidence
-   Follow a validation plan to validate assessment practices and judgements. At least 50% of products must be validated within the first three years of each five-year cycle.
-   Be qualified to train and assess by having:
    -   the training and assessment qualifications listed in the standard
    -   current vocational skills at least to the level being delivered and assessed
    -   current industry skills
    -   engage in ongoing professional development for both their vocational area of expertise and in VET practice
-   Be aware of changes to training packages and stop delivering superseded qualifications or units of competency.

**Standard 2. The operations of the RTO are quality assured**

This standard means the trainer and assessor must monitor the training and assessment and systematically evaluate and use the outcomes of these evaluations to continually improve the training and assessment strategies. This includes using validation outcomes and client feedback.

**Standard 3. The RTO issues, maintains and accepts AQF certification documentation in accordance with these Standards and provides access to student records**

For the trainer and assessor, this means:

-   Ensuring students meet all requirements of the qualification and unit/s of competency
-   Marking the assessments to enable the AQF certificate to be issued within 30 calendar days of meeting the requirements
-   Providing credit to students already holding units of competency.

**Standard 4. Accurate and accessible information about an RTO, its services and performance is available to inform prospective and current students and clients**

A trainer and assessor must be careful not to guarantee that:

-   A student will successfully complete a qualification or unit of competency
-   A qualification or unit of competency can be completed in a manner that does not meet the requirements of the training package or the amount of training required
-   A student will obtain a particular employment outcome.

**Standard 5. Each student is properly informed and protected**

Trainers and assessors cannot start training and assessment without giving prior advice to the student about how they will be trained and assessed. All of this information must be accurate and transparent.

Students must have time to prepare for the course between enrolment and training commencing.

Trainers and all RTO staff must ensure their behaviour protects student rights and follows processes and yearly training should be provided to review these requirements

**Standard 6. Complaints and appeals are recorded, acknowledged and dealt with fairly, efficiently and effectively.**

The RTO is to have a transparent complaints and appeals policy that enables learners and clients to be informed of and to understand their rights.

All students must be given reasonable opportunity to provide feedback about any issue related to the RTO.

Students must know how to make a complaint or an appeal

## Case study

Andrew has been training and assessing automotive students for many years. He holds the TAE40110 Certificate IV in Training and Assessment. The Standards for RTOs 2015 require him to gain the TAELLN411 Address adult language, literacy and numeracy skills and the TAEASS502 Design and develop assessment tools units. Andrew has enrolled in these units.

Andrew is a qualified automotive mechanic. He has worked for a range of automotive repair businesses. He works on Saturdays at an automotive repair workshop to keep his industry skills current. Andrew regularly goes to trade nights to keep up with industry trends and to discuss with industry representatives how best to make the training and assessment he delivers relevant to the industry needs.

# Learning theories

Despite decades of extensive research, we still don’t really know how we learn. There are a number of theories that each appear to describe different examples of learning, but there is no one coherent, elegant description to summarises all instances and examples of learning from the mundane day to day learning to navigate a new supermarket layout to the more profound learning of a different set of behaviours to relieve instances of social awkwardness to the complex concepts that are rocket science.

There are three main learning theories that dominate the research literature. These theories are dominant because they have been the most extensively researched and have substantial supporting evidence, are broadly applicable to a range of contexts and have withstood rebuttal and interrogation. The key theories include:

-   Behaviourism
-   Cognitivism
-   Constructivism

| Theory         | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Application                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Behaviorism    | Behaviorism is only concerned with observable stimulus-response behaviors, as they can be studied in a systematic and observable manner. Proposes that learning is a process whereby the students learns to display a particular behaviour in response to a stimuli through the presence of either reward or punishment. Associated with Classical and Operant Conditioning | Learning is based on a system of routines that "drill" information into a student’s memory bank, as well as positive feedback from teachers and an educational institution itself.  If students behave in a desirable way, they receive positive reinforcement and are signaled out for recognition. Where students behave in an undesirable way, they are punished accordingly. |
| Cognitivism    | Cognitivism recognises that learning is a process that occurs through thinking.  Proposes that the brain is able to absorb information, link it to pre-existing information to modify “understanding” and then file that information for later retrieval and use                                                                                                            | Focuses on the acquisition of information and the role of pre-existing understandings of information that are modified as new information is absorbed. Questions may be asked that allow students to refine their thinking and recognise where they may be incorrect. Discussion allows students to access novel information from the experiences and perceptions of their peers |
| Constructivism | The learner builds upon his or her previous experience and understanding to "construct" a new understanding. Learning occurs through making meaning of experience Learning takes place by acting on the environment and testing ideas Social context is important                                                                                                           | Students are provided with opportunities to develop and test hypothesise, solve problems, and explore the content to construct their own understanding. Reflects the learning gained through practicing and making mistakes to refine and improve performance.                                                                                                                   |

# Instructional design principles and models

Training packages are designed to enable flexibility in the design of training and assessment. There are many different ways you could deliver training and assessment. Instructional design refers to the creation of learning program experiences and materials and can be used to develop engaging training as well as learning and assessment resources. Strong instructional design will assist trainers to prepare strong sessions and will create engaging learning experiences for students.

## Instructional design principles

M. David Merrill, an educational researcher and teacher, created the first principles of instruction that can be used to assist instructional designers, teachers and trainers to develop instructional materials for positive student learning.

The first five principles are stated as follows:

1.  “Learning is promoted when learners are engaged in **solving real-world problems**. (eg get learners working with real-world problems or tasks that they can relate to – from the workplace)
2.  Learning is promoted when existing knowledge is **activated as a foundation** for new knowledge. (eg using existing prior knowledge and draw this into what is being taught to develop new knowledge)
3.  Learning is promoted when new knowledge is **demonstrated** to the learner. (demonstrate using a variety of engaging strategies, ie visually, orally)
4.  Learning is promoted when new knowledge is **applied** by the learner. (Have tasks where learners apply the new knowledge. Have discussions if errors are made, discuss why, how can they be fixed. )
5.  Learning is promoted when new knowledge is **integrated into the learner’s world**.” (integrated into the learners world by knowing their characteristics and use discussion, reflections)

[^14]: https://discoverlearning.com.au/2021/06/how-to-apply-merrills-instructional-design-principles/

Merrill broke the five principles down into further detail.

**1. Learning is promoted when instruction is problem-centred.**

Show Task: Provide a worked example of the task that learners will complete.

Task Level: Ensure learners are engaged at the problem and task levels, as well as the operation or action level.

Problem Progression: Begin with a basic problem then build the complexity to scaffold learning.

**2. Learning is promoted when instruction activates existing knowledge.**

Previous Experience: Tap into learners’ existing knowledge and experiences.

New Experience: Ensure tasks are engaging, interesting and authentic.

Structure: Begin with a basic problem then build the complexity to scaffold learning.

**3. Learning is promoted when instruction includes demonstrations.**

Demonstration Consistency: Provide content with demonstration and examples that reflect the learning outcomes.

Learner Guidance: Provide multiple representations of ideas, concepts and perspectives.

Relevant Media: Ensure media supports effective learning.

**4. Learning is promoted when instruction provides opportunities for application.**

Practice Consistency: Align practice activities with learning outcomes.

Diminishing Coaching: Gradually withdraw coaching to build learner independence.

Varied Problems: Provide opportunities for learners to apply their learning to different contexts

**5. Learning is promoted when instruction supports integration into the real world.**

Watch Me: Provide opportunities for learners to demonstrate and share their learning.

Reflection: Include reflection activities to recognise progress.

Creation: Encourage learners to transfer their learning to their own lives.

## Instructional design models

There are many instructional design models and methodologies that can be used to develop engaging training and assessment. Below are a variety of models of instructional design for you to consider.

### ADDIE model

This model is a process to develop your training program. It represents a series of steps to work through to ensure you are producing quality work. It is not a model that can be used to meet student needs or support students, it is about the processes you take as an instructional designer.

This model can be considered to work as a continuous cycle, particularly when you are able to deliver the one area of content multiple times to different student groups.

1.  **Analysis[^15]** - Identify the instructional problem, learning goals, learners and timeframe.
2.  **Design** - Identify the learning objectives, instructional methods and activities, storyboards, content and media assets.
3.  **Development** - Develop content and learning interactions. Graphics, audio, and video are also produced. The content is tested, reviewed and amended.
4.  **Implementation** - Implemented in the Learning Management Systems (LMS). Training provided to course facilitators. Students are registered. The planned program is delivered.
5.  **Evaluation** – Evaluation is continuous throughout each stage of the cycle. Collect and review data for continuous improvement.

When developing a learning activity such as a game it can be useful to employ the ADDIE methodology.

**Analysis**: think about what material you want to game to cover, what game you want to play and what your timeframe is.

**Design**: consider how the game will be played (group or individually), the format and topics

**Develop**: This is where you would make the game and any resources required for it.

**Implementation**: the fun part, learners can play the game. Also consider a trial with peers before using it in the classroom

**Evaluation**: take note of how the game is going while its being played. Are the any things that aren’t working and need to be changed? Encourage students to comment on what they thought of the game, what they liked and disliked. Ask students to review what they learnt. This allows you to see if the activity was effective.

### Gagné's Nine Events of Instruction

Gagné's Nine Events of Instruction describes nine steps in a sequence of learning and is a particularly useful structure when teaching a new skill as it provides a structured approach to formulating a lesson plan that is applicable to many practical skills.

**Attention**

People form opinions in seconds and tend to sustain their initial perceptions. It is important to gain their attention quickly. Begin with an introductory activity that engages the learner. This could be an icebreaker activity, a series of controversial and thought provoking discussion points that introduces the topic

**Objectives**

Inform the learner of the learning objectives – what they will be able to do when they finish the course and the lesson. These may be provided within the course materials but should be covered explicitly at the beginning of each session. This practice is also important for supporting the needs of learners with weaker learning skills.

**Recall of prior learning**

Encourage learners to recall and build on their previous knowledge or skills. This could be via a recap of previous lessons, recounting past experiences or drawing the relationship between previous content and the current content.

**Content**

Use a variety of methods to present the content, including methods that allow any time access and discussions with other participants. The greater demands on students to be actively doing something, the higher their level of engagement and the richer the learning that will occur. Variety in these demands, considering a change in activity or pace every 10 minutes will assist students to keep engagement levels high.

**Learning guidance**

Guide learners through activities with instructions, timelines and opportunities for collaboration. Provide students with instructions on how to learn, such as guided activities or common pitfalls. With learning guidance, the rate of learning increases because students are less likely to lose time or become frustrated by basing performance on incorrect facts or poorly understood concepts. Include detailed information for projects and activities. Provide expectations, instructions, and timelines.

**Elicit performance**

Allow students to apply knowledge and skills learned. Encourage students to apply what they are learning in group or individual projects and activities, written assignments, lab practicals, and so on. Scaffold high-stakes assessments with smaller activities so students can practice and receive feedback before turning in something for a larger grade.

**Provide feedback**

Give students feedback on individualized tasks, thereby correcting isolated problems rather than having little idea of where problems and inconsistencies in learning are occurring. Provide detailed feedback on assignments showing students what was done correctly, what must be improved, and include explanations. Give formative feedback on smaller assignments as well as summative feedback on larger assessments. Utilize peer-evaluation and self-evaluation or self-assessment methods.

**Assess performance**

The assessment process can help students identify content areas they have not mastered and a lot of learning typically takes place while undergoing assessment. Utilize a variety of assessment methods including exams/quizzes, written assignments, projects, and so on. Utilize rubrics when grading activities that are not standard exam and quiz questions. Ensure that students have practiced and received feedback prior to high-stakes assessments.

**Enhance retention and transfer to the job**

Prepare students to apply information to personal contexts. This increases retention by personalizing information. Provide opportunities for students to relate course work to their personal experiences when designing essays and projects. Allow students to reflect on what they have learned and how they will use that knowledge or those skills in the future. Have students create a reference for their future selves that summarizes what they have learned.

### Bloom’s Taxonomy – revised

The revised Bloom’s Taxonomy describes six levels of knowledge, and the abilities arising from applying this knowledge simple to complex and concrete to abstract. The taxonomy describes the cognitive processes that are being applied to the knowledge in question. It stresses the importance of establishing objectives and assists the trainer/assessor to:

-   plan and deliver appropriate instruction[^16]
-   design valid assessment tasks and strategies
-   ensure that instruction and assessment are aligned with objectives

    This model is particularly useful when working with knowledge heavy aspects of a unit of competency or area of content.

Many teachers feel uncomfortable working with students on the lower levels of the taxonomy, particularly the Remember level as rote learning has been subjected to much negative press as an ineffective learning approach. This level is often under served as a result. However, all levels are equally important in learning with remembering being important for broadening and diversifying a student’s knowledge base. When working at the higher levels of the taxonomy, a student will draw on their knowledge base to solve problems, evaluate positions and make judgements. The strength of a student’s knowledge base will also assist them to fluidly move across the different levels of Bloom’s Taonomy.

Traditionally the higher levels of the taxonomy have been considered the more advanced skills, however these aren’t necessarily reflective of student capability – even young children are able to create new works, although perhaps the quality may differ.

For example, for a series of Computing lessons that teach students how to build a webpage, the first lesson could explain to them about HTML, leading to a discussion about an example of HTML script and how it translates into a webpage (Level 1 – Remembering), before asking them to explain the purpose of different parts of the HTML script (Level 2 – Understanding). Students would move on to applying their knowledge and understanding of HTML, to begin building their own basic webpage, requiring them to solve any problems in their script (Level 3 – Applying), and then investigating additional features that could be added to their webpage (Level 4 – Analysing). As the lessons continue, students could be challenged further to critique their website, assessing its strengths and how it could be improved (Level 5 – Evaluating). At the pinnacle of Bloom’s taxonomy, it would be expected for students to create something completely new or original, producing a website that fulfils a particular purpose (Level 6 – Creating).

Bloom’s taxonomy can be particularly helpful when writing learning outcomes with the associated verbs allowing trainers to explicitly describe the type of performance they are requiring from their students. It can also be used as a structure for your knowledge based lessons.

## Case study

Rebecca has had mixed results in her training and assessment. There are times when students just do not seem to engage, and their learning progress is slow.

Rebecca decides to do some research on instructional design principles. She notes common features between different models of instructional design that apply to training and assessment:

-   Consider the learner characteristics and design to suit their characteristics at all stages
-   Develop clear objectives
-   Use a variety of methods
-   Build on existing knowledge and skills
-   Plan each stage of the training and assessment
-   Evaluate throughout for continuous improvement.

Rebecca gathers information regarding:

-   The learner’s characteristics
-   The purpose of the training.

The purpose of the training assists her to create meaningful objectives. She notes the mixed characteristics of the learners and creates icebreakers and activities, which will allow learners to share their prior experiences. These experiences can be used as a foundation for learning.

Rebecca notes that some of her learners like technology, while others prefer printed materials. She creates a range of methods for training and assessment. Rebecca decides that she will check in with learners during the training to see if she needs to make further modifications to her course.

# Learning programs

A learning program is a plan that documents the training you intend to deliver over a specified period of time. This plan may be for a series of linked workshops or lessons, or it may be for a segment of a whole course or qualification. This is the first document to be developed for a proposed program and when completed acts as a road map for all the decisions that come after. There is considerable opportunity for you to flex your creative muscles in developing a learning program and it can be very rewarding to take a program from these first ideas to seeing your students performing their new skills in the workplace.

A learning program is an attempt to marry the demands of your client, the needs of your students, and the demands of the training product into one documented program outline. While your learning program won’t document the detail of how the training product requirements will be met, you need to keep a close eye on all three aspects when making decisions about how you will satisfy these stakeholders all at once.

## Design learning programs

The processes and components that go into creating a successful learning program include:

-   Consultation – as part of the design process and throughout the training and assessment, important to confirm the critical aspects of delivery including content, outcomes, expectations and budget
-   A clearly defined purpose of the training and assessment to ensure there are clear benchmarks and expectations for the trainer
-   Awareness of the characteristics of the leaners to enable customisation of the training where required
-   Analysis of training packages and units of competency
-   Application of the AQF levels and required volumes of learning
-   Application of design principles to develop an engaging program outline
-   Contextualisation of the training and assessment to reflect the workplace context and better meet the client needs
-   Application of the dimensions of competency in training and assessment
-   Adherence to VET and organisational standards
-   Parameters such as cost, timeframes, location to ensure these parameters can be met by the client
-   Research existing content.

Review the topics listed above before writing your learning program. We will work through each of these areas as part of this cluster.

When developing your training program, all the decisions you make against each point need to coherently support each other.

The **purpose** of the learning program may include

-   developing vocational competency/vocational skills
-   developing generic skills
-   developing language, literacy, numeracy
-   developing general education
-   achieving organisational change
-   supporting organisational skill development
-   for professional development purposes
-   developing teams
-   meeting new legislation, licensing or registration requirements
-   meeting regulatory and WHS requirements
-   meeting funding body requirements
-   upskill to new equipment or facilities
-   compliance with legislation or licensing requirements
-   to gain a competitive advantage over other organisations and to be seen as a specialist in the industry
-   increase employment opportunities or to change careers.
-   recognition of previous skills
-   induct and train a new incumbent

It is important to confirm the purpose of the program with the client once you have developed the strategy, specified the required outcomes of the program, identified the suitable training products such as units of competency, and determined the number of learners and budget for the program.

The **focus** of a learning program may be

-   a short course/vocational program
-   a professional development program
-   a community education program
-   a workplace learning program
-   part of a VET in Schools program
-   part of an apprenticeship/traineeship
-   a short-term development plan developed by a coach
-   a short-term induction program

Your focus would be identified and refined through the outcomes of your stakeholder consultation, your learning objectives or outcomes and an analysis of the training products you intend to use, whether units of competency or qualifications.

## What is learning?

Learning is a personal process, which occurs internally. Learning can involve:

-   Growth of knowledge
-   Development of skills
-   A change in attitudes.

Learning can occur as a result of systematic learning and/or as a result of experiences. There are multiple ways to learn. People approach learning in different ways. Learning means different things to each of us.

Creating a learning plan is an exciting and rewarding part of being a trainer in the VET sector; you need to follow the benchmarks, but you have the freedom to decide the best ways to do this for your students, your industry and your personal preferences.

## Relationship between documents

There needs to be a clear relationship between the **training package/accredited course**, **learning/training and assessment strategies**, and the **learning program**.

**Training package/accredited course**: Training packages standardise training across RTOs. They contain information about nationally recognised courses and the units that make up each course.

-   Training packages and accredited courses define the outcomes expected of the learner. They do not prescribe delivery strategies. Decisions about the processes of delivery and assessment are up to you, in your role as trainer and assessor.
-   Accredited courses address skill requirements for industry, enterprises and the community, which are not already covered in nationally endorsed training packages.

Other performance standards and criteria can be used as the basis of the learning program. These may include standard operating procedures and codes of practice from different organisations.

In vocational education and training, we tend to use training packages as they provide pathway opportunities for lifelong and recognised learning.

The **main** difference between Training packages and accredited courses is that training packages are government created and approved and accredited courses are created by private individual, groups or business to fill a niche and has been approved by the government.

<https://getcourse.com.au/blog/difference-between-training-packages-and-accredited-courses/>

**Learning/Training and assessment strategy**: A training and assessment strategy (TAS) **must** be developed for each training product (unit or qualification) your RTO delivers. The TAS outlines the methods the RTO will use to enable the learners to meet the requirements of the training package.[^17] The TAS is used in an audit as evidence that all the requirements of the training package have been considered, especially in regards to the volume of learning and ensuring that there is sufficient provision of resources to meet the needs of the learner group. It provides the direction and scope of training and assessment over the long term.

[^17]: Standards for Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) 2015

**Learning program:** The learning program describes the way in which the training and assessment strategies will be implemented. The learning program is an operational document, which may be adjusted during the training and assessment to better meet the needs of the learners.

A learning program should identify the:

-   Purpose
-   Target group, their needs and characteristics
-   Outcomes to be achieved
-   Learning and assessment activities
-   Resources required
-   Learning objectives
-   Structure and sequence for learning
-   Plan of how the learners will achieve the objectives
-   Content of the learning
-   Delivery and assessment methods.

## Where do I start?

![Begin with the end in mind (Stephen Covey)](media/a385d7846624333b063484701c10e99f.png)

Planning is the key ingredient to successful training programs. Your consultation with stakeholders should have enabled you to identify an appropriate training package or accredited course for the basis of the program. The following steps and questions will help you to create your learning program.

1.  **Analyse the units of competency or modules.**

    To maintain the integrity of nationally recognised qualifications, you must start by analysing the units of competency involved in the program. These will define the outcomes.

-   What will the learner need to DO?
-   Can similar content from multiple units be integrated and delivered holistically?
-   What assessment methods could be used?

    Delivering holistically is more realistic to workplace application and can reduce the timeframes required for the course.

    At this stage, you just need an idea of the assessment methods you will use.

1.  **Consider the language, literacy and numeracy requirements of the program.**
-   What will the learner need to read, write and orally communicate?
1.  **Review the characteristics of the learner and their impact on the design.**
-   Will the learners need more time because they have learning difficulties or no experience in the field?
-   Is the learner a candidate for RPL? RPL needs to be considered upfront as it will alter the funding and the duration required for learning.
-   What are the best methods for your students to learn?

    Face-to-face, work-based, online, or distance learning are all different approaches that can be used. Answering the following questions and reading the following tips will help you choose the best method for your learners:

    -   Are my learners independent and self-motivated?
        -   Would a blended approach to learning using a mix of face-to-face and online learning be suitable?
        -   Would a visit to a workplace inspire learners and enable them to ask recognised experts questions?
            -   These excursions can take more planning and require more time to undertake than lectures but can be more engaging.
        -   To achieve the required skill level, how much hands-on practice will they need?
            -   Remember, learning should be undertaken over a period of time to enable feedback and improvement. You are not going into the detail of session plans at this stage; you are just getting an idea of the timeframes and resources required.
1.  **What are the timeframes available?**

    Funding arrangements often mean a course needs to be completed within a certain timeframe. Where you are delivering training to an organisation, their learners may only be available at certain times, and there may be a deadline to have the training and assessment complete.

2.  **What policies and procedures apply to the training and assessment?**

    Policies and procedures may impact on the way you deliver the training and assess your learners. Think about VET standards, industry standards and organisational quality assurance policies and procedures. An Enterprise Agreement, for example, may regulate what you can ask your learners to do and may define the hours that the training can be delivered.

    Review the Organisational standards and VET standards topics for more information.

3.  **Research, develop and document specific subject matter content.**

    Research whether a similar program has been developed and whether that can be modified. Google credible sources and review books for ideas. Do not be afraid to make a rough draft. You need to start somewhere and documenting the program helps clarify your thoughts. Keep a close eye on your unit to make sure you meet those demands.

4.  **Delivery mode and methods**

    Decided on a delivery mode – this would be done in consultation with the client – it could be face to face, online, off site, on their premises, blended, virtual etc.

    Decide on the delivery methods that will best support student engagement and help your students achieve the stated outcomes for the program. You need to allow opportunities for practice, feedback and reflection for all skills aspects of your program.

    Consider how your delivery methods will support and build on each other to give an appropriate progression through the content. Each delivery method will need to link together and take the student on a learning journey from their starting point to their learning outcomes.

5.  **Evaluate existing resources.**

    Review the Evaluate existing resources available for your topic, identifying gaps where additional resources may need to be sourced or developed. Consider how each resource will be used to support the delivery methods and the structure you have put around these methods

6.  **Decide on assessment requirements.**

    Review the Assessment strategies topic

## Structuring the learning program

This means creating a delivery plan for the learning material.

Once you know the competencies or benchmarks you will use, you can break the training into specific goals (or learning outcomes) for each session. For each, you could ask, ‘What must the learner be able to do at the end of each session?’ That is a learning outcome.

Scientists have discovered that we can only remember approximately seven pieces of information, plus or minus two, at a time. If you try to cram too much into a session, your learners may feel overwhelmed and forget important information. Break the learning into manageable segments by:

-   Scaffolding - start with a very simple application with lots of support and increase the degree of difficulty and reduce the support over time
-   Identify patterns and similarities between the units and deliver together or in sequence
-   Present information using a variety of methods to appeal to all learning styles and assist your learners in remembering the information.

You must structure the learning program in a way that best supports learners to achieve the identified benchmarks:

-   What should they learn first?
-   What is the logical order of the topics?
-   What skills need to be developed and practised before moving to the next stage of developing their competence?

Decide where you can split the content to create a series of sessions.

## Documenting the learning program

Now you should be ready to document the learning program. Using a template:

-   Is an efficient way of documenting a learning program
-   Ensures that everything is covered
-   Is easy for stakeholders to review.

Following is an example of a completed template for a learning program.

# Purpose of training and assessment

There must be a reason to conduct training and assessment. If you are not clear on why you are doing it, you run the risk of wasting your time and that of your learners.

There are many reasons training and assessment may be required. These may include:

-   Compliance with legislation or licensing requirements
-   To achieve organisational change
-   Professional development
-   To gain a competitive advantage over other organisations and to be seen as a specialist in the industry
-   Increase employment opportunities or to change careers.

The reason for training and assessment helps shape the design of the training and assessment. For example, if training is taking place for compliance with legislation, then there are specific benchmarks that must be met. Professional development provided as an employee incentive may be more informal and not require assessing.

## Learning Outcomes

From a clearly defined purpose, learning outcomes or program objectives can be developed. These are statements about what a student will be able to do after the training, assuming the training has been effective.

They articulate what students will achieve as a result of your training program and how their learning will be measured. They will drive your design decisions and direct you program planning.

A Learning Program Outcome is a **measurable, observable, and specific** statement that clearly indicates what a student should know and be able to do as a result of the learning planned in the program.

Outcomes can be written for qualifications, units of competencies or individual classes.

Clear learning outcomes are a valuable decision-making tool for the training as they are designing the program, they are also critical for the client to determine if their needs will be met, and they are important for students to direct their own learning.

Strong learning outcomes will follow the below formular:

At the end of this program, students will be able to:

\+ Verb + Subject + Level of Achievement (if applicable) + Condition of Performance (if applicable)

Some examples are below and are colour coded to show the different components:

-   At the end of this program, students will be able to identify five different support services available on campus for students
-   At the end of this program, students will be able to design, develop and present a training program designed to meet compliance, industry, and student needs

There are a number of verbs that should be avoided in your learning outcomes as they cannot be measured. Because they can’t be measured, you can’t know when your students have achieved the learning outcome. The most common example is “Understand”. To understand something can be to varying levels of depth so you can’t determine whether a student understands something deeply enough. Instead, consider what you want the student to be able to do with that understanding – this will lead you to a more appropriate verb.

Other verbs to avoid include:

-   Understand
-   Know
-   Comprehend
-   Appreciate
-   Be familiar with
-   Study
-   Demonstrate your understanding
-   Be aware
-   Become acquainted with
-   Gain knowledge of
-   Cover
-   Learn
-   Realise
-   Better understand

There are a number of frameworks that link verbs with different levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy (covered in the chapter on Instructional design principles). These can be a useful source of appropriate verbs. One example is below, however there may be other verbs that are applicable to your vocational area or industry:

# Consultation

Consultation is an important key to effective training and assessment. People have different perceptions and gaining different perspectives from others is likely to lead to engaging training and assessment, and consultation can help identify any potential problems proactively.

Consultation should be undertaken at various stages throughout the training and assessment program:

-   **Before starting the training**: to clarify the purpose of the training and to establish the best methods of maximising the relevance of training by relating the training back to the workplace (contextualising).
-   **After the initial draft of a learning program**: to check your program will meet the expectations of the stakeholders. This is the time to check the delivery and assessment methods are suitable.
-   **Throughout training**: to ensure the training and assessment is staying on track and meeting its purpose. Consultation also allows you to monitor progress towards the goals of the program. The requirements of the training may change as the training progresses, and a greater need is identified. At times, you may need to consult with specialists for guidance. For example, if there are learners that have a language, literacy and numeracy (LLN) need you might seek advice from an LLN Specialist.
-   **After training and assessment:** to establish if the training and assessment met the needs of the stakeholders. Consultation at this time also identifies any areas for improvement.

## Who are the stakeholders?

Stakeholders can include the:

-   Industry associated with the training – When you are preparing students to enter employment in an industry, your stakeholders may be a range of contacts representing that industry – from associations to major employers.
-   Sponsors of the training – This could be a specific organisation seeking targeted training.
-   RTO staff – This could include your supervisor and staff associated with compliance or even other trainers and assessors involved in similar training and assessment.
-   Learners – All training and assessment should be learner-centred. The learners are undertaking the training and assessment first hand and are a valuable source of information. When a trainer becomes a specialist in an industry, it can be difficult for them to see the training and assessment from a learner’s perspective who may be new to the industry. What may be familiar and obvious to you due to your years of exposure to the industry, may be confusing and unclear for a learner. Gaining feedback is a great way to improve your training and assessment.
-   Specialists who have assisted with support needs.

Following is an example of when consultation is appropriate.

# Contextualisation

Training packages do not come with prescribed delivery strategies or specific content. Decisions about the content, and how to deliver and assess the units or qualifications are made by the trainer. This means that trainers have maximum flexibility to tailor training and assessment to the learners.

Standard 1 of the Standards for RTOs 2015 specify that:

*“The RTO’s training and assessment strategies and practices are responsive to industry and learner needs and meet the requirements of training packages and VET accredited courses”*

In order to reflect the needs of industry and students, the training, materials and assessment needs to reflect the context that the students will be working in.

Contextualisation is the process of making learning programs, learning materials or assessment tools more meaningful to the learners, through using resources from their workplace. This can include:

-   Workplace documents and forms
-   Equipment
-   Policies and procedures
-   Altering the location and structure of training, eg, for school-based VET students.

These resources may be included in learning materials, assessment tasks, or student workbooks.

Contextualising **cannot**:

-   Alter the integrity of the outcome of the unit
-   Remove an element or performance criteria (part or all)
-   Alter the detail within the unit to such a degree that it distorts the competency outcomes and limits its use
-   Change the AQF level of any aspect of the unit
-   Diminish the breadth of application and reduce its portability.

    **NOTE**: **Context**ualising also involves designing the training program in such a way that it reflects the workplace **context**.

    This is different to **custom**isation which considers the specific learning needs of the student (as the **customer**)

    This is a common area of confusion. You will often be asked throughout your assessments for examples of contextualisation – ensure you are discussing the strategies you would use to ensure the training reflects the workplace context

## Case study 1

Justine is delivering the unit BSBMGT401 - Show leadership in the workplace, to students at a local council. The unit of competency includes the following components:

**Performance Criteria:**

1.  Ensure management performance and behaviour meets the organisation’s requirements

    2.1 Use organisation’s standards and values in conducting business.

    **Performance Evidence:**

-   Identify the organisation’s standards and values, whether stated or implied by the way the organisation conducts its business
-   Evaluate own behaviour and performance against these and adjust to achieve required standards.

    **Knowledge Evidence:**

-   Articulate organisational values and expectations of behaviour.

To contextualise her training and assessment, Justine:

-   Asks the Human Resource Manager for a copy of their values and Code of Conduct
-   Have the students review their organisation’s values and Code of Conduct
-   Have the students brainstorm acceptable and unacceptable behaviour
-   Includes an assessment question about when the dollar value of a gift must be disclosed, and when a gift must be rejected.

## Case study 2

Brian is training and assessing a group from a mining company in driving a heavy rigid vehicle. The unit of competency includes the following components:

**Performance Criteria:**

1.  Heavy rigid vehicle is started, steered, manoeuvred, positioned, and stopped in accordance with traffic regulations and manufacturer’s instructions.

    **Performance Evidence:**

-   Carrying out pre-operational checks
-   Completing relevant documentation.

    **Knowledge Evidence:**

-   Pre-operational checks carried out on heavy rigid vehicle and related action.

Brian is aware some of the drivers have low literacy skills.

To contextualise his training and assessment, Brian:

-   Produces a handout simplifying the language from the manufacturer’s instructions and breaks the task into steps
-   Arranges copies of the workplace pre-operational checklist for the drivers to complete using their actual workplace vehicles
-   Organises for the drivers to practise driving and be assessed using the vehicles at their workplace.

## Activity 19.1: Contextualising

Locate a unit of competency from [training.gov](https://training.gov.au/Search/Training?TypeAllTrainingComponents=true&nrtNewSearchSubmit=New+Search).au that you could use to train and assess your students.

1.  Complete the following table using an example from this unit of competency. You may prefer to print or save a copy of the unit.

| Code and name             |   |
|---------------------------|---|
| **Performance criteria**  |   |
| **Performance evidence**  |   |
| **Knowledge evidence**    |   |

1.  Describe how you could contextualise the components you have listed from the unit of competency.

## Contextualisation in assessment

In the same way that contextualisation can be applied to the learning process and material, it can also be applied to assessment. For similar reasons of improving the relevance of the assessment for students by reflecting the workplace, it can also improve the reliability and validity of assessment outcomes.

Workplace resources can be used in the same ways, for example a WHS assessment would ask students to complete the hazard inspection form from their workplace, adapting instructions for online learners or re-writing questions that refer to legislation relevant to a private sector organisation to reflect the equivalent public sector legislation.

The same limitations to contextualisation of learning applies to contextualisation of assessment. The integrity and scope of the unit must be maintained, and the conditions of assessment need to be met, however the strategy for assessing the unit can be contextualised as far as required. This could include assessment methods, assessment tools and instruments, templates, tasks, and instructions.

# Organisational standards

Organisational standards apply whenever you train or assess. You will have to comply with the VET standards and:

-   Your RTO standards
-   The organisation standards applicable to the learner’s workplace.

The organisational standards generally interpret how that organisation will comply with legislation. Organisational standards are normally documented as policies and procedures.

**RTO standards** may include:

-   Enrolment procedures
-   Learners’ needs identification and support available
-   Assessment marking timeframes
-   Record keeping for training and assessment events
-   Purchasing process and authorisations for acquiring resources for training or assessment
-   Travel procedures where training is not being conducted on the RTOs premises
-   Validation plans and processes
-   Qualifications required of trainers and assessors
-   WHS policy and procedures
-   Assessment templates to be used
-   Grievances and appeals process.

**Organisational standards** applicable to the student’s workplace may include:

-   Workplace agreements around working conditions
-   Standard operating procedures for using equipment and machinery
-   WHS policy and procedures
-   Access and equity policy
-   Quality assurance
-   Licensing requirements

**Policies and procedures commonly held within RTO’s:**

-   Enrolment procedures
    -   ensure there is a cut off date otherwise having learners dropping in can affect the learning of others
    -   ensure there is time from enrolment acceptance and before course commences for orientation and preparation of learners
    -   ensure access to all RTO systems are given and working
-   WHS
    -   WHS risk assessment done prior to each training session
    -   Risk assessment and WHS is monitored during sessions
    -   Ensure preparation for emergencies or lockdowns
    -   COVID sanitation
    -   For assessing off site in a workplace a risk assessment of the working site is to be undertaken and monitored
-   Trainer code of conduct
    -   Complete code of conduct training and other mandatory training
-   Professional Development
    -   This is ongoing – currency for industry and currency in VET practices.

Using organisational standards will ensure you meet the requirements of the organisation and maintain compliance with legislation. Where organisational standards are incorporated as part of the training and assessment content, it will have a high degree of relevance for the organisation.

**Industry standards** and those standards applied to various industries that as a trained you need to abide by eg Electrical, carpentry, plumbing, hospitality all have certain standards that need to be abided by.

## Privacy Code of Practice

The Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 (PPIP Act) outlines how New South Wales (NSW) public sector agencies, which include RTO’s, manage personal information.

It provides protection of personal information held by government agencies and imposes obligations on government agencies in the collection, storage, use and dissemination of personal information.

An RTO will hold personal details of all learners and as a trainer and assessor within an RTO you must abide by the Act and not disclose any personal details of any learners.

## Case study

Max is delivering training and assessment at a local tannery. He asks the tannery what organisational procedures he needs to follow. Max finds out he:

-   Will need a Q fever shot before entering the site for his own health and safety
-   Must sign in and out through reception when delivering training
-   Must follow the organisational procedures when training and assessing the students on the forklifts.

He knows his RTO requires him to:

-   Receive a signed enrolment form from all participants before commencing training
-   Use the TAFE NSW validated assessments
-   Follow the car booking procedure
-   Give feedback within two weeks of candidates completing assessments
-   Record the assessment outcomes within three weeks of students completing all requirements.

## Activity 20.1: Follow organisational procedures

Research your organisation’s policies and procedures. Note the policies and procedures that need to be followed when you conduct training and assessment.

# Characteristics of learner groups

All training and assessment should be learner centred. The learners’ characteristics should be taken into consideration when designing the learning and determining methods of assessment. Failure to take into consideration learner characteristics may result in barriers to learning, which can be frustrating for both the learners and the trainers or assessors.

Characteristics that should be considered in a learner group profile include:

-   Occupation
-   Cultural/language background
-   Educational background or general knowledge
-   Language, literacy and numeracy needs
-   Physical ability
-   Socio-economic background
-   Previous experience with the topic
-   Work and parental commitments
-   Attitude to learning.

Also consider learning styles and whether the learners are:

-   Visual, auditory or kinaesthetic learner
-   Activists, reflectors, theorists and pragmatists.

Learning styles are covered in more detail in the learning styles topic.

There are other characteristics that can be useful to know, but are not necessarily as important from an instructional design perspective as your design should cater for the full diversity of these characteristics. These include:

-   Age
-   Gender

Adjustments made to a training program to meet the learning needs of students is referred to as customisation. This is often confused with contextualisation. You will recall that contextualisation refers to adjustments made to reflect the workplace context, whereas customisation refers to adjustments made to reflect the need of the customer/student.

## Equality and equity

When you are making decisions about delivery modes and methods, these decisions need to support your learner needs as far as possible and should aim to reduce barriers to learning.

Not all students will have the same support needs and this will raise the question on the difference between equality and equity. The below cartoon demonstrates the difference between these two concepts:

![Equity vs. Equality: What&\#39;s the Difference? \| Mental Floss](media/07ce5d649b28e2ea2911c5c6f0c44860.jpeg)

Equality refer to the inputs – all students receive the same support measures, regardless of whether they require them or not.

Equity considers the outputs – students receive the level of support required to achieve the same outcomes.

This represents an ideal world and sometimes there are factors that means we can’t always achieve perfect equity, however we have an obligation to ensure our program design works towards ensuring maximum equity and doesn’t exacerbate areas of inequity.

It is important to ensure students with a disability, medical condition or some other impairment are able to access assessments on an equivalent basis to other students. This may require adjustments be made to assessments. It may also require specific supports be put in place to help students overcome performance barriers associated with their condition.

## Case study

Haven Council is concerned that their insurance premiums have risen due to an increase in the number of workplace accidents. They have engaged TAFE NSW to deliver basic work health and safety to all their staff. The trainer/assessor requests information on the characteristics of the staff and takes into consideration how these characteristics may require modifications to the training and assessment design.

# LLN requirements

## Identifying the LLN of the training

As a trainer and assessor, you will need to identify the language, literacy and numeracy (LLN) requirements of the training and assessment, the workplace and the skills of your students. While we will look at this is a lot more detail in the next cluster, it is useful to briefly consider these aspects as part of the design process.

**Language:** refers to the words, verbal structures and actions we use when we communicate in our “day to day” lives.

Language includes:

-   Speaking and listening
-   Writing, reading and interpreting symbols
-   Non-verbal communication such as gestures, posture, personal space and eye contact
-   Visual communication for example sign language (Auslan)
-   Languages other than English.

**Literacy:** refers to the process of reading, extracting meaning from writing and responding in writing, in a range of contexts. Literacy includes identifying mathematical concepts in the written form.

**Numeracy:** refers to working with numbers in real situations in different contexts (community, work, and training).

Numeracy includes:

-   Using basic number skills
-   Using spatial and graphical concepts
-   The use of measurement, including the ability to estimate
-   Problem-solving

## Digital Literacy: there is a growing recognition of the importance of digital literacy skills for daily and work life. These skills include:

-   Navigating digital devices
-   Sourcing required information and digital resources
-   Interacting safely in a digital environment

## Trainer’s role in developing LLN skills

RTOs must meet the Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) Standards. These standards require the RTO to determine the support needs of individual students and provide access to the educational and support services necessary to enable the learner to meet the requirements of the training and assessment.

As a VET trainer, you will not be expected to teach a student how to read and write, however you will be introducing students to unfamiliar documents, jargon and mathematical calculations. By putting some simple support mechanisms into your delivery, students can often not only achieve the required learning outcomes, but also achieve stronger LLN skills along the way.

## LLN required by the training program and workplace

The training packages define industry expectations for workplace tasks.

Every training program and assessment requires learners to demonstrate their competence in workplace tasks and these tasks will often require speaking, listening, reading, writing and mathematical skills. The level of the LLN skills required will vary depending on the industry and the role of the worker. For example, an accountant needs a high level of mathematical skills, while a journalist needs a high level of writing skills.

Start by considering what your learners need to read, write, say and hear (oral communication), calculate (numeracy) and learn, to practically perform the tasks required in the training and in their workplaces. Consider the types of documents they are required to read or complete.

Many units of competency now have a foundation skills section that indicates which performance criteria require language, literacy, numeracy and employability skills. Two examples are below. Note the difference in the information provided across training products.

# Delivery modes and methods

As a trainer and assessor, you get to decide how you will deliver the training. A delivery mode describes the way training will be delivered to support and enable learning. The type of delivery mode you will choose will impact on the way learners engage with the learning material and the way they experience the learning process. Broadly speaking, there are three delivery modes:

-   Face to face
-   On the job/Work-based learning
-   Online/E-learning (Mostly asynchronous)
-   Blended (combination of Face to Face and Online)
-   Connected delivery (Synchronous replication of Face to Face via online communication methods)
-   Coaching

For each delivery mode, there are a number of different delivery methods that can be utilised. A delivery method is the way elements of content are communicated to the learners.

### Face to face

Rapport can be built quickly with face-to-face training. Face-to-face training offers the most flexibility in the delivery methods that can be used. It also has the benefit of instant feedback and is effective when the training involves elements of behavioural change. Participation and engagement can be reported as being higher in a face to face environment as there are additional and immediate demands placed on the student, particular where group work is employed. Typically, with some creativity and careful use of technical functionality, these delivery methods can also be used in connected delivery modes.

-   Consult with stakeholders during the planning stage to help you meet the needs of the client.
-   Consider the learner characteristics. This will assist you in choosing appropriate delivery strategies that focus on learners’ areas of strength.
-   Use a variety of methods to maintain engagement and assist with retention.
-   Consider efficiency and effectiveness. PowerPoint presentations may deliver the content quickly, but can have low engagement and retention of information may be poor.

As a general guideline, change activities or have a break after about one hour.

### Online Learning/E-learning

Can involve a variety of methods from web-based learning to video conferencing. Typically allows for the student to self-pace their learning and does not have a set class schedule. Learning occurs asynchronously. Regardless of the format, they all rely on technology to deliver training. The advantages and disadvantages of e-learning are:

| **Advantages**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Disadvantages**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Preparation**                                                                                |

| Online or e-learning programs are effective for training across multiple locations. They save the company money on travel expenses. They can be a less expensive way to get training from expert industry professionals and consultants from outside the company. They are useful for refresher training. They are good for self-directed learning. Encourages participation and engagement They can be easy to update with new company policies or procedures, federal regulations, and compliance issues. They offer trainers a growing array of choices for matching training programs to employee knowledge and skill levels. Recordings become a useful revision tool Learners who cannot attend class at a specific time can still participate in learning. Can be effective for delivering for very large groups | These programs require learners to be computer literate. They are usually generic and not customised to your learner’s needs. Some employees may not like the impersonal nature of this training. Employees may be too intimidated by the technology or the remoteness of the trainer to ask questions. Lack of computer terminals or insufficient online time may restrict or preclude access to training. Inadequate or outdated hardware devices (for example, sound cards, graphics accelerators, and local area networks) can cause programs to malfunction. Your company’s internet servers may not have enough bandwidth to receive the materials. Self-instruction offers limited opportunities to receive context-specific expert advice or timely response to questions. | Instructions on how to access e-learning and information on resources required to participate. |

Some examples of E-learning are described below.

**Web-based training.** This method makes training available on the internet. Web-based training provides a hands-on, interactive way for learners to work through training materials. Training materials are standardised because all learners will use the same program. Materials are also easy to update, so your training is always up to date with your industry. Web-based training programs are also often linked with software (a learning management system, or LMS) that makes learners’ progress trackable, which makes recordkeeping very easy for the training administrator or ASQA audits.

**Video conferencing.** These methods allow the trainer to be in one location and learners to be dispersed in several locations. Participants are networked into the central location and can usually ask questions of the trainer. Lectures and demonstrations can be effective in using this method.

**Audio conferencing.** This method is similar to video conferencing but involves audio-only. Participants dial in at the scheduled meeting time and hear speakers present their training. Question and answer sessions are frequently held at the end of sessions in which participants can email questions or call in and talk to a presenter.

**Web meetings or webinars.** Participants access a link via their computer. Depending on the options selected, you may see and hear the presenter and be able to follow their presentation on the screen.

**Online college and university courses.** This method is also known as distance learning, and many schools now offer certificates or degrees through online programs that require only minimal on-campus attendance.

### Work-based learning

Learning that occurs in the workplace is highly relevant to the learners

| **Advantages**                                             | **Disadvantages**                                                                                                | **Preparation**                                                                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tasks are realistic. A higher degree of contextualisation. | The venue may not have great training facilities. Learners may be interrupted by their work during the training. | Clear plan shared with the organisation regarding when the training will occur and what equipment is required. |

### Blended learning

Blended learning uses a combination of delivery methods. Blending face to face with an online component is often popular.

| **Advantages**                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Disadvantages**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Preparation**                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Learners can complete the e-learning or distance learning component at their own pace. Reduces the cost of training. Provides a more interactive learning experience. E-learning can provide 24/7 access. | Lack of motivation on the learner’s part to complete the course. Plagiarism and credibility of sources can become a problem. Some employees may not like the impersonal nature of this training. Technology can be challenging rather than useful, for example, internet drop-outs. Trainers may become overworked. High cost set up and maintenance.  | A clear plan including a schedule of face-to-face training and timeframes for completion of online components.  Information on how to access online content and information on the resources required. |

### Coaching

Learning that occurs in the workplace is suitable for highly motivated learners with clear goals

| **Advantages**                                                                                               | **Disadvantages**                                                                                                                                                                       | **Preparation**                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Highly adaptable to the learning goals of participants Highly relevant to students working 1:1 with a coach  | Relies on peers in the workplace No formal recognition of learning outcomes achieved No formal assessment of learning outcomes achieved A typically expensive approach due to being 1:1 | Clear plan shared with the organisation regarding what is expected to be achieved as a result of the coaching |

**General rules of learning**

| **Active learning**                | People learn by doing. Active learning means that the learner contributes answers and ideas during initial learning.                                                                                             |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reinforcement through practise** | Practise is where real learning takes place. It reinforces what you have taught and generates understanding.                                                                                                     |
| **Feedback**                       | Tell the learner how they are doing and give praise and encouragement.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Meaningful material**            | Learners must know why they need the knowledge and skills and where they fit into an overall picture. It must be relevant to their needs.                                                                        |
| **Motivation**                     | Adjust your approach to meet the motivational needs and abilities of the learners.                                                                                                                               |
| **Reflection**                     | Encourage learners to go over the information you are covering. Do not expect to tell them once and assume they will remember it. Using recall and review is important.                                          |
| **Previous knowledge**             | Draw on the previous experience of the learners and link this to the skills they require.                                                                                                                        |
| **Senses**                         | Use a variety of senses to meet the needs of the learners and their learning styles, which may be a mixture of kinaesthetic, visual and auditory.                                                                |
| **Sequence**                       | Present small chunks in a logical sequence. Points presented at the beginning and end of a training session are remembered better than those in the middle. The two most important points should be given last.  |

## Activity 23.1: Delivery modes

Suggest an appropriate delivery mode for each of the students below.

1.  Carly is a shift worker with irregular hours. She finds she cannot go to sleep immediately following the late shift when the rest of the world is fast asleep.

|   |
|---|

1.  Markesh is undertaking an apprenticeship in metal fabrication.

|   |
|---|

1.  Suzy needs her frontline staff trained in customer service, but she cannot have her staff away from the business for too long.

# Learning resources

Learning resources are any material that you use to support your content. It includes things such as learner workbooks, powerpoint slides, worksheets, videos and other materials

Do not “reinvent the wheel”. Check online, RTO learning banks or ask other trainers and assessors for training and assessment resources. We all stand on the shoulders of those who have gone before us. It will be rare that you find yourself delivering wholly new content so starting from scratch is not a good use of your time. Gaining resources from a wide source will give a variety of perspectives and suit the diversity of your learner group. Before using a resource check:

-   Copyright and the terms in which you are permitted to use the resource
-   Compatibility with the area in which you will be using the resource. For example, legislation may vary between countries and states.
-   Currency – is the resource up to date with current industry standards?
-   Relevance – how closely does the resource reflect the learner's industry or reflect the requirements in the unit of competency?
-   Suitability – is the complexity of the resource pitched at the appropriate AQF level, will it meet the learners’ needs, does it suit learner preferences?
-   Adaptability – can the resource be modified to better suit the learners?
-   Flexibility – can the resource be used for different modes of delivery, such as online or face to face, or are there technology issues associated with using it?
-   Quality – is it a clear recording, a legible print/photocopy, is the font and format appealing and is the resource free of errors?
-   Reliability – is the source of the information or resource a reliable source?

    For any resource, you need to consider carefully how it helps your student get closer to achieving your learning outcomes, how you will use it and how your students will interact with it. If it doesn’t contribute to your learning outcomes, don’t use it – no matter how funny, cute or inspiring it is.

    Key areas to find resources include:

-   Internet
-   Organisation’s policies, procedures, intranet
-   Media
-   Training manuals
-   Industry body publications
-   Product manuals and other materials from suppliers
-   Safework NSW
-   Industry skills committees
-   Lectures and presentations from industry events
-   Vocational textbooks

    It is recommended that you consider starting your personal library of resources now. Start collecting media articles that are relevant to the areas you will be teaching, collect the URL’s to useful websites, keep a record of useful videos. Think about how you will store and catalogue your resource collection as it grows and develops with a range of different types of resources.

## Copyright

There are laws that protect intellectual property. Copyright in Australia is automatic and does not have to be applied for. Before you use an existing resource, check the copyright laws.

Copyright applies to:

-   Text
-   Artistic work
-   Music
-   Computer code
-   Sound recordings
-   Film.

If the resource has been produced under contract, normally the copyright belongs to the organisation that paid for the contract. This means if you produce any learning materials as part of your work with an RTO, the copyright stays with the RTO, not you – even after you have left the RTO, unless you specify to the contrary in your employment contract.

Many RTOs will have a Statutory Education copyright license that allows you to use materials for educational purposes. Check with your RTO manager to confirm your RTO has this license.

Providing a link to a source on the internet is not regarded as copying. Otherwise, seek permission from the copyright owner.

There are numerous copyright-free resources available. Creative Commons is a licensing system where copyright owners choose to make their work available.

Check copyright rules through the [Australian Copyright Council](http://www.copyright.org.au/)[^18].

## Facilities and equipment

Facilities and equipment are often confused with learning resources but are separate considerations. Whereas the learning resource communicates aspects of the content to the students, resources are materials they may require to assist them practice skills and facilities refer to the environment in which they might practice these skills. Some examples are below:

| Facilities                                  | Equipment                                |

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|

## Activity 24.1: Find existing resources

Undertake research to determine what training and assessment resources already exist that you could use.

Your methods of research can include:

-   Asking colleagues or other participants in the course you are undertaking
-   Searching the internet
-   Enquiring with an industry body that represents your industry
-   Joining vocational education and training groups or forums and asking them about shared resources.

List any sources of training resources or assessments that you found useful.

# Developing new activities

Developing new activities to match your learners’ needs creates training with a high degree of relevance. Relevant activities improve:

-   Engagement
-   Retention of knowledge and skills.

Activities that enhance learning include:

-   **Collaboration** – where learners share experiences and learning from each other. This assists the learners to make links between their existing knowledge and new knowledge. Collaboration can be as simple as a brainstorming activity or discussion.
-   **Gamification** – adds an element of fun. For example, matching games where a definition is matched to terminology by splitting the learner group into teams and asking them questions. Teams gain points for every correct answer.
-   **Reflection** – a personal reflection by the learner on what has been learnt, how it applies to the individual learner and identifying areas for improvement can accelerate their learning.
-   **Experiential activities** – these are activities that will demonstrate a learning outcome through the experience of participating in the activity. They will often have an emotional or values-based component to them.
-   **Scenarios** – are particularly useful for commercial groups who are undertaking the training to solve a workplace issue. The scenario can subtly mirror the workplace situation and encourage discussion and problem-solving. These can also be used as the basis for role plays.
-   **Kinaesthetic activities** – are hands-on training activities that engage the senses (touch, sight, hearing, taste and smell). For example, in a cooking class have the students BBQ a piece of steak noting the senses used to make decisions around cooking timeframes and then enjoy a steak sandwich together.
-   **Knowledge quizzes** – there are many technology-based programs that allow you to run knowledge quizzes (Kahoot, Socrative, etc) in your classroom. These add an element of fun competition and allow students to identify weaknesses in their knowledge. Having students write questions for each other can also provide a valuable review of content.

There are many sources of training games and activities available on the internet and via books. Many activities can be used to demonstrate a range of different learning outcomes depending on how the activity is debriefed.

## Case study

Melissa teaches Certificate IV in Training and Assessment. There is a lot of terminology and principles that learners need to understand and remember. Melissa creates a board game and divides her class into small teams. On certain squares on the board game, the learner must pick up a question card. Each team must answer their theory questions correctly and in many cases, give an example to advance further. The first team finished wins. Melissa has noticed how much more engaged the learners are in theory when there is a small amount of competition involved and that they learn from each other.

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|

## Activity 25.1: Develop activities

Suggest an activity that could be developed for each of the following situations:

1.  Cora’s students are studying counselling. Oral communication in tense, and possibly volatile situations, is a skill they need to develop.

|   |
|---|

1.  Phil is teaching first-year automotive apprentices with low literacy skills. They need to identify different engine parts.

|   |
|---|

1.  Zander is teaching a WHS course for a commercial organisation. The manager of the organisation requested the training because staff have not been reporting WHS incidents.

|   |
|---|

# Assessment strategies

The assessment process is valuable to all stakeholders of a training program. It gives valuable feedback to the student regarding their achievements and future areas for development, it provides evidence to the client of what was achieved through the program and it gives feedback to the trainer as to whether their program has been successful in achieving the stated outcomes.

## Deciding the assessment approach

Assessment can be:

-   Summative – which involves candidates being assessed at the end of a period of training
-   Formative –which involves assessments conducted over a period of time
-   Diagnostic –which determines the training needs of learners.

![Summative: Assessment that occurs at the end of the period Formative: Assessment that takes place over a period of time Diagnostic: Assessment that is used to determine educational and training needs](media/3b0e690f93bdca2bc00adf93fd4ea3d8.png)

© TAFE NSW 2019

Formative assessment:

-   While it doesn’t formally contribute to a final outcome for a student it can inform the assessor as to the student’s progress over time
-   Provides the candidate with feedback throughout the training. This can help build the skills of the learner over time.
-   Is useful for learners who suffer assessment anxiety. Having smaller tasks is less daunting, and the anxiety is likely to reduce as they get familiar with the assessment process, improving their performance in the summative assessment

    Summative assessment:

-   Contributes to a final outcome for the student and provides holistic feedback regarding a student’s performance
-   Is used for reporting purposes both against government subsidised training contracts and for employers

    Diagnostic assessment:

-   Is used before the commencement of a training program to ascertain pre-existing skill levels and training needs
-   Is usually used to determine LLN levels in VET or as part of a recognition of current competency process
-   Has the potential to provide a useful starting benchmark where student improvement is being measured

## Types of evidence

There are three main types of evidence:

1.  **Direct evidence**: is obtained when the assessor directly observes the candidate actually perform the task. It is the best form of evidence to guarantee that the assessor is gathering authentic evidence. Oral questions, which an assessor asks while a candidate is actually performing a task, can be counted as direct evidence too.
2.  **Indirect evidence:** is where evidence has not been directly observed. Examples of indirect evidence may include a portfolio of documents provided to support an RPL application, such as references, appraisals, workplace documents and logbooks
3.  **Supplementary evidence:** is when the assessor requires additional evidence. Supplementary evidence is insufficient on its own. Verified copies of past qualifications and interviews with the candidate or their current supervisor are examples of supplementary evidence.

A range of assessment methods should be used to:

-   Cater to individual differences
-   Ensure the dimensions of competency are met
-   Meet the principles of assessment and rules of evidence.

The assessment could involve:

-   Observation of the candidate completing tasks in the workplace. This evidence may be recorded and sent along to the assessor, or the assessor may attend the workplace and observe the candidate as they actually perform the task
-   Observation of candidate completing tasks in a simulated environment (role-play)
-   Portfolio - a collection of documents that would typically be used in a workplace
-   Project
-   Products the candidate has created
-   Responses to a case study
-   Theory questions
-   Third-party reports
-   Self-assessment
-   Interview.

# Work, health and safety (WHS)

The *Work Health and Safety Act 2011* and Work Health and Safety Regulations 2011 are the legal documents containing laws to protect the work health and safety of all workers.

**Codes of Practice** provide advice on how to meet the regulatory requirements. An example relevant to some RTOs is Code of Practice – Hazardous Manual Task 2019

**SafeWork NSW** also has guidelines to clarify the legislation. The current legislation in NSW is Work Health and Safety Act 2011

**Standards** define the minimum acceptable standard that products must comply with. For example, there are standards regarding glass used in buildings. There are also standards that relate to management systems. A common one, particularly in RTO’s delivering qualifications with high WHS risks is Australian Standard 31000:2018 Risk Management

RTOs and workplaces have:

-   Policies
-   Procedures.

These policies and procedures outline how the RTO and workplace will meet the legal requirements. Trainers and assessors need to make sure that any training and assessment they are providing, follow these policies and procedures.

Keeping the workplace safe includes:

-   **Correct use of equipment and** machinery, by providing and maintaining the equipment necessary to do the job safely
-   Following safe methods of working ie providing or ensuring learners have correct PPE to ensure **learners do not injure themselves**
-   Providing information and instruction on workplace hazards and supervision of employees in working safely to **ensure a safe learning environment**
-   Maintaining records on health and safety, including incident and accident reports.

Everything reasonably practicable must be done to protect the health and safety of others at the workplace. Everyone has responsibilities for [^19] WHS .

Trainers and assessors must consider where the training is taking place and be aware that a change from delivering at an RTO where they normally conduct training, to a workplace, may introduce risks. A risk assessment and control plan should be undertaken before delivering any training and assessment. This should also consider students’ lack of experience with a workplace, equipment and procedures being taught which may heighten the WHS risk associated with an activity.

A common approach in assessing risk is to identify the hazard and rank the risk.

-   A **hazard** is any situation that can cause harm to people or property.
-   The **risk** measures the likelihood of the hazard and the severity of harm.

Risks that are very likely and can cause severe harm need to be dealt with immediately. Compare the following two examples:

**Example 1**

Hazard - paper cut from their assessment

Risk likelihood/severity – low and minor injury

Risk ranking – low, no action required.

It is not reasonably practicable to remove all paper from the training and assessment environment.

**Example 2**

Hazard - using cutting devices and welders

Risk likelihood/severity – high risk of severe injuries

Risk ranking – high, use control measures including PPCE and standard operating procedures

A trainer and assessor need to know the risks related to the work role and should be familiar with common hazards relating to the industry.

Common hazards in a training and assessing environment include:

-   The arrangement of furniture in a room
-   The use of electrical devices such as data projectors
-   Trip hazards from power cords
-   Fire
-   Lockdown events
-   Bullying and harassment
-   Manual handling risks

WHS information can be found by consulting the organisation’s WHS policies and procedures, safety data sheets, safe work methods, standard operating procedures, WHS hazard and risk audits and inspections, industry bodies, Safework NSW.

## Risk controls

The Hierarchy of Controls outlines the preferred method of controlling risks. Elimination is the most preferred method. Often you will use a mixture of methods to reduce risk to your learners.

![Image depicting the preferred method of controlling risks](media/b70f43bf93a287d7ff8430f5f4d7d97f.jpeg)

© TAFE NSW 2019

-   Eliminate: Remove the hazard
-   Substitute: Replace the hazard with something less dangerous
-   Isolate: Reduce the amount of exposure to the hazard
-   Engineer: Modify the design of the equipment to make it safer. For example, fit guards near cutting blades
-   Administrative: Use a procedure that is a safe way of working
-   Personal Protective Equipment: This includes clothing, gloves, masks and boots.

When you undertake your risk assessment and produce your control plan, aim to have your controls at the top of the hierarchy.

The organisation’s safe work methods will be a valuable resource for outlining the correct approaches to completing a task and working with equipment. These documents will also highlight the associated risks and the controls that need to be implemented to maintain safety of students and yourself.

Immediately before starting training or assessment, the trainer/assessor should inform learners of:

-   The emergency evacuation
-   The procedure, hazards and control measures associated with the tasks to be undertaken.

Trainers must monitor learners’ behaviour toward each other and manage any inappropriate behaviours.

As a trainer you need to be aware that risks need to be assessed before you start the training and then during the training. Just because you check before doesn’t mean WHS issues won’t arise during the actual deliver.

Before the training you would:

-   Carry out a **risk assessment** to identify risks. Assess these risks as to whether they are high, medium or low and determine a control measure for each (see Activity 21.1 below)
-   Carry out a **Hazard inspection** of the training area/venue to check machinery is working, electrical items are tagged and tested, venue is safe and free of any issues
-   **Personal protection equipment** – some industry this is a must. Ensure learners have these or provide them for the leaners. It is good practice to inform learners of any special requirements prior to the session.

During the training look for:

-   **Inappropriate behaviour**: as a trainer you must monitor and manage any inappropriate behaviour as it could lead to injury. Ensure strict boundaries and rules are in place from commencement of training and refer back to these often and especially when a learner displays inappropriate behaviour
-   **Injury or incident report:** in the event of an injury, the injury must be recorded, and an incident report completed
-   **Emergency evacuation procedures**: This must be covered at commencement of any training and ensure that all learners know what the procedure is.
-   **Ergonomics**: Whether the delivery is online or in a face to face situation it is advisable to review ergonomics post op this also applies to workshops.
-   **Venue information**: explain to her learners what facilities are available, and if the venue changes ensure that you represent is not

**WHS policy and procedures relating to your role as a trainer and assessor**

| Policies and procedures                                     | Relationship to trainer and assessor                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hazards relating to the industry and specific workplace** | If training is to take place offsite at a client’s workplace, the trainer is to ensure that a risk assessment of the premieres are carried out and document. This assessment is to include all possible WHS issues                                        |
| **Risk assessment**                                         | This must be completed prior to every training session to ensure safety of all learners both on or off site. Any issues are to indicate a control measure and give an indication if it is high, medium or low risk. Complete the Risk Checklist template  |
| **Hazard identification**                                   | If a hazard has been identified, it must be first reported to your line manager via email.

## Activity 27.1: Control measures for WHS

There are two parts to this activity

**Part 1:**

1.  Brainstorm with the group (or if you are on your own, make a list) of all the possible risks that could occur or be in your classroom
2.  Do some research – use this site to start with <https://www.tafensw.edu.au/about/policies-procedures/work-health-and-safety>
3.  list them in the table below and identify if they pose a high, medium or low risk
4.  in the *control measures* list a different control measure for each hazard.

| Hazard | H | M | L | Control measures |
|--------|---|---|---|------------------|
| 1.     |   |   |   |                  |
| 2.     |   |   |   |                  |

**Part 2:**

Identify risks that relate specifically to your industry area .

## Emergency procedures

During an emergency, the trainer or assessor will be responsible for the safety of their students.

Before working in a unfamiliar location, you should familiarise yourself with the emergency procedures for that location. This will include both evacuation and lockdown procedures. Know the phone numbers for the first aid officer, any security personnel. Having these numbers saved into your phone can be helpful. Also be familiar with the location of your emergency assembly point.

In the case of an evacuation, ensure the safe exit of your students from the building, taking your attendance sheet with you and report to the warden and follow their instructions further. You are not expected to operate any emergency equipment such as extinguishers that you are not trained on or don’t feel confident with. Similarly, you are not expected to provide first aid above your skill and confidence level.

In the instance of a lockdown, secure the learning environment as far as reasonably possible, keep students from view and ensure everyone remains quiet with phones switched to silent.

From time to time, an evacuation or lockdown drill may interrupt a class or assessment. Despite the interruption, support your students to participate in the drill as an important measure to keep them safe in the learning environment as a controlled and effective response to emergencies is critical for survival.

## Personal protective equipment

It is the RTOs responsibility to provide all Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for you and your students. As a trainer, you are responsible for ensuring all students know how to correctly use their PPE and then use it correctly. PPE must always be worn correctly during an assessment event, and this will often be a requirement in the units of competency where PPE is relevant. The maintenance and storage of PPE will often be included in the instructions and expectations around using PPE for learning and assessment purposes.

# Review

The VET environment is a very competitive and dynamic market.

To keep a slice of the market and gain more learners, you need to follow a review process, including:

-   Monitoring
-   Seeking feedback
-   Evaluating
-   Continuously improving.

## Monitoring

Waiting until the end of a program to judge its effectiveness is too late. Monitor the training and assessment as it is happening, gives you the opportunity to adjust and get the program back on track.

Monitor individual students to ensure they are progressing towards the outcomes required. This monitoring could include:

-   Observing the learner’s behaviour in class:
    -   Are they engaged, actively participating in activities and asking questions that suggest an expanding grasp of the topic?
    -   Do they run late, miss classes, or leave early? This may indicate a problem.
    -   What is their body language portraying?
-   Checking the learner’s ability with activities or progressive assessments:
    -   Does their completion of activities or progressive assessments indicate they understand the content?
    -   Are answers to activities and assessments improving?
-   Discussing progress with the learner. Ask them how they are feeling about the program. An informal discussion can help you pinpoint early if anything needs to change.
-   Monitoring how external learning is integrating with work-based learning. To do this, you might:
    -   Ask a workplace supervisor if they have noticed a development in skills the learner is using in the workplace
    -   Check with the learner if the external learning reflects how tasks are completed in the workplace
    -   Visit workplaces and observe modern practices.
-   Monitoring supervisory arrangements:
    -   Learner’s need to be appropriately supervised for WHS reasons and to assist in making the learning a positive and productive experience. If learners are not given appropriate levels of supervision for their knowledge, skills and experience, they may lose confidence
    -   Review the progress of the learner to determine if supervisory arrangements are adequate.
-   Monitoring the effectiveness of the learning/facilitation relationship:
    -   This is particularly important where training is delivered for an organisation or involves one-to-one training
    -   Work-based training often uses a mentoring/coaching style that relies on a relationship where the learner is comfortable to proactively ask questions and seek assistance
    -   Regular meetings with stakeholders can be used to monitor the relationship and progress of the learner.

## Seeking feedback

You should always seek feedback from stakeholders. Review the Consultation topic for more information on who you should get feedback from, and when.

The learner, as the recipient of the training and assessment, is one of the best sources of feedback available. Specialists who have assisted with support needs can also give valuable feedback.

Feedback can be gathered:

-   **Informally** through discussion. People are often more open about suggestions for improvement through informal feedback.
-   **Formally** through surveys. This enables particular aspects of the training and assessment to be measured.

## Evaluating

Training and assessment should always be evaluated. You can evaluate by:

-   Collating the information you have received from your monitoring and seeking feedback. Are there any trends in the data? Where the same areas for improvement have been suggested by a number of people, make it a priority to make changes.
-   Self-reflecting. There are many studies reporting the value of self-reflecting. Review your session plans. Were there any areas that felt rushed? Were there activities that did not work as well as you planned?
-   Analysis of statistics. Reviewing the attendance patterns and records of outcomes provides objective information.

## Continuously improving

Use the information you have gained from the monitoring, feedback and evaluation to identify how the training and assessment can be improved.

Document any evaluation or review undertaken and include in your documentation:

-   The process undertaken to complete the review
-   The findings from the evaluation or review. Include a variety of perspectives
-   Options for improvements
-   Recommendations of what improvements should be implemented.

Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) are heavily audited. Having proof of feedback and evaluations demonstrates processes are in place for continuous improvement.

# Introduction to the LLN Unit

Welcome to your next cluster in yourTAE40116 Certificate IV in Training and Assessment – the LLN unit.

In this cluster you will be covering one units of competency:

-   TAELLN411 - Address adult language, literacy and numeracy skills (Release 2)

You will develop the skills necessary to support the development of LLN skills in the workplace. This will include

-   Determining workplace LLN demands
-   Determining training LLN demands
-   Testing students’ LLN skills
-   Identifying and implementing strategies in the classroom to support students with weak skills

Before commencing this unit, it is recommended that you access and watch one of the series of “Lost for Words” available on SBS on demand. This program will give you rich insight into the role of language, literacy and numeracy in everyday life and how debilitating weak skills in these areas can be for students. Your teacher may also use this as a resource when teaching this unit.

This is a unit that a lot of students find difficult. For many students, the concepts and material in this unit is highly unfamiliar and you will be asked to engage with language in a way that you may not have in the past. Reflect on the challenges and frustrations you face throughout this unit – chances are they mirror the challenges and frustrations your students with weak LLN skills experience. Appreciating that emotional dimension will help you be a better teacher.

# Workplace LLN

A high percentage of Australians have difficulty solving everyday problems, and with numeracy, writing and reading skills.

## Activity 30.1: What does this say?

Try reading the passage below.

![The passage has p, d, q and b inverted representing how a dyslexic may see written material.](media/cd13aed882719107adf7d42158251eab.png)

This will give you an understanding of how difficult reading can be for some people. For example, dyslexic learners may invert ‘p’, ‘d’, ‘q’, ‘b’.

Refer to the ABS, [Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey 2006](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4228.0Main+Features12006%20(Reissue)) for statistics about the high percentage of Australians that have difficulty solving problems and with numeracy, writing and reading skills.

Watch the following video called [Literacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmWhpGODicw) [is everyone’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmWhpGODicw) [business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmWhpGODicw) by the Community Services and Health Industry Skills Council.

Every workplace has tasks which require:

-   Speaking
-   Listening
-   Reading
-   Writing
-   Mathematical skills
-   Digital skills
-   Learning skills.

Collectively, these are referred to as language, literacy and numeracy skills (LLN). The level of LLN skills required will vary depending on the industry and the role of the worker.

For example:

-   An accountant needs a high level of mathematical skills
-   A journalist needs a high level of writing skills.

To determine the LLN skills required to practically complete work tasks, ask “What do the learners need to”:

-   Read
-   Write
-   Say and hear (oral communication)
-   Calculate (numeracy)
-   Learn.

Consider the type of documents they are required to read or complete. Two workplace examples showing LLN Skills and documents required follow.

# Australian Core Skills Framework

The [Australian Core Skills Framework (ACSF)](https://www.education.gov.au/download-acsf)[^20] provides a national approach, which trainers can use to identify and share information on a learner’s core LLN skills. It is a framework that can be used to discuss ethe skill demands of a workplace, the skill demands of a learning environment, describe the skills of a student, express goals and learning outcomes in language, literacy, and numeracy classes. It provides a common language and a common understanding of skill descriptions.

[^20]: <https://www.education.gov.au/download-acsf>

It is designed to be used for native English speakers living, working, and studying in an Australian context. It is not intended to be used to measure English language proficiency for speakers of other languages. There are other, more nuanced frameworks to measure language proficiency in that context.

The ACSF is an intimidating document when students first start to engage with it. It is recommended that you read and understand the front material (red), but it isn’t necessary to read each page of the rest of the document. Instead, use it as a reference point to benchmark your observations.

The ACSF assists trainers to assess a learner’s level of skill in learning, reading, writing, oral communication and literacy.

## Five core skills

There are five core skills in the ACSF:

-   Learning
-   Reading
-   Writing
-   Oral communication
-   Numeracy.

Within the five core skills, there are five levels of ability:

### Pre Level 1 Supplement

The ACSF also identified a level below level 1, to represent the different cohorts who are unable to demonstrate performance at level 1. This level tends to describe the skills of individuals who are not native English users.

For further information, review the following document:

[Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) - Australian Core Skills Framework](https://research.acer.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1011&context=transitions_misc) (PDF)

### Learning skill

While these five skills are mostly self-explanatory, the learning skill is one that may be unfamiliar. A set of key principles underpins the Learning core skill:

-   Learning is a purposeful, goal-directed activity, undertaken to achieve objectives that are valued by the learner.
-   Learning is an active process of gaining understanding and developing skills. Learners draw on their prior knowledge and experience as they shape meaning.
-   Learning is socially constructed, occurring within, and strongly influenced by, context and culture.
-   An individual’s knowledge and skills are contextualised and do not necessarily transfer neatly from one situation to another without adaptation. Effective transfer requires practice, time and appropriate support.
-   Learning does not necessarily occur in a logical, incrementally increasing fashion. Each time individuals take on a new challenge, they are likely to need time, support and resources before their performance improves.
-   Learning has cognitive, emotional and social dimensions. Although all individuals learn, not everything that is learned about learning is necessarily positive. Some adults have developed negative perceptions of themselves as learners. This can act as a barrier to further learning, particularly in formal contexts.

## Performance indicators

The five core skill areas in the ACSF have a total of 11 performance indicators. Indicators are statements that briefly describe performance at each level of the five core skills. There are 11 Indicators; two each for Learning, Reading, Writing and Oral Communication and three for Numeracy.

Learning, Reading and Writing:

-   the first Indicator describes a person’s performance in terms of goals/purposes, meaning-making and overall management of the process
-   the second Indicator focuses on practical strategies to assist with achieving the desired outcomes.

Oral Communication:

-   the first Indicator focuses on speaking
-   the second Indicator focuses on listening.

Numeracy:

-   the first Indicator focuses on identifying (through reading, observing or listening) what mathematics is required
-   the second Indicator focuses on mathematical procedures and processes
-   the third Indicator focuses on representing and communicating the mathematics.

In all cases, it is important to recognise the critical interplay between the indicators. The indicators are numbered according to the core skill, using a decimal system in which the whole number refers to the level and the decimal component to the core skill. For example, someone who has demonstrated level 1 in Learning will have achieved both 1.01 and 1.02. Someone exiting at Learning level 4 will have achieved both 4.01 and 4.02. These indicators describe the factors that contribute to each core skill:

| Core Skill             | Indicator \# | Description                                                                  |

## Performance variables

The ACSF recognises that many factors may influence a person’s performance. These factors include:

-   The level of support an individual requires to complete a task
-   The familiarity of the context
-   The complexity of the text
-   The complexity of the task.

Each of these performance variables will need to be considered when identifying a learner’s core skill levels. There are five levels of performance listed on the left-hand side of the table below.

|       | Support                                                                                  | Context                                                                                                                         | Text Complexity                                                                                                               | Task Complexity                                                                                                                                                         |

## Communication domains

There are three different environments in which we use LLN. These environments are referred to as the **domains of communication**. These domains include:

-   Personal and community
-   Workplace and employment
-   Education and training.

**The workplace and employment domain** in the ACSF Framework gives examples of workplace tasks for each ACSF skill level and is helpful in determining the LLN requirements for the training. The way a procedure is implemented in the workplace may influence the ACSF level. For example, a WHS record where a pro-forma template is used which only requires a limited amount of writing could be considered to be at an ACSF level 2, whereas more detailed WHS records could be considered to be at an ACSF skill level 3.

## Digital Literacy Skills Framework

In 2020 the Digital Literacy Skills Framework (DLSF) was released. This document acts as a supplement to the ACSF, adding digital literacy as a sixth skill. Within this framework, digital literacy is only described up to ACSF level 3. All other features of the ACSF – performance variables, domains of communication etc, remain consistent to the DLSF.

## How to use the ACSF

The ACSF is not the AQF. Different work positions have different LLN requirements.

Trainers and assessors are not required to be experts in the ACSF. You are required to identify if LLN skills are likely to be a barrier to training and put strategies in place to assist learners with low LLN skills.

To determine LLN requirements, look at what the learner has to:

-   Listen to and understand
-   Say
-   Read
-   Write
-   Recognise - diagrams, pictures, or symbols
-   Mathematically calculate.

The easiest way to use the ACSF and identify the ACSF level is to:

-   Compare the workplace tasks with the examples given in the workplace and employment domain
-   Review the foundation skills table in streamlined units of competency. It will list which performance criteria require LLN skills and a description
-   Search for the words that indicate an LLN skill is required (trigger words) in traditional units of competency and identify the relevant skills for each trigger word. Often the trigger word will be the first verb in the performance criteria.
-   Start looking at the ACSF by consulting the Performance Features Grid in Appendix 1 which provide summaries that are useful for comparing levels
-   Confirm your level selection by reviewing the descriptions of activities in the domains of communication
-   Confirm your level selection by reviewing the more detailed descriptions of each level
-   Ask learners to complete validated LLN assessment tools that are written at the ACSF level of the unit of competency.
-   Compare students’ work to the ACSF starting with the Performance Features Grid

Using the ACSF is as much an art as it is a science. Often there may not be one, definitively correct answer. This makes it critical for you to be able to back up your conclusions with arguments. Be clear and explicit on why you have decided that particular level is correct.

# Learners LLN

Determining the LLN skills of your learners identifies the appropriate level of support for your learners to meet the requirements of training.

Can your learners?

-   Express themselves well enough to be understood clearly
-   Understand workplace instructions
-   Read and fully understand what they are reading
-   Write legibly and concisely to make themselves understood
-   Use numeracy skills to the appropriate level in order to fulfil their job tasks.

The learners LLN skills can be assessed:

-   Before enrolling in a training course
-   At the start of training
-   During training
-   On completion of training
-   On the job.

The learners LLN skill level can be determined by the following.

**Formal assessments:** A formal assessment involves using a validated LLN tool based on the ACSF. These tools should be used by skilled and trained LLN specialists, where available, who can interpret the results. Validated tools include the ACSF Assessments provided by Precision Consultancy and the RU Ready electronic assessments conducted at TAFE.

**Semi-formal assessments:** May be carried out by an RTO or trainer who has the TAELLN411 competency. This form of assessment is usually in the form of a structured activity, which is reviewed to estimate a learner’s LLN levels. The trainer then decides if specialist support or modifications to delivery or assessment are required. These structured activities may include learners completing:

-   A pre-enrolment or registration form
-   A telephone conversation with the trainer using scripted questions to determine oral communication
-   Course-related tasks/questions
-   Self-assessment checklists measuring LLN skills in varying contexts (community, education, workplace)
-   A workplace task, such as filling in a form.

| Write a report                             |     |           |    |

**Informal assessments:** Informal assessments usually take the form of observations and/or discussions with the learner/worker. Completing workplace documentation and a discussion with the workplace supervisor of the learner is helpful when the learning is being supported by a workplace.

**Observation:** Involves watching a person’s behaviour during normal work activities or training sessions. During the observation, focus on how the student handles tasks involving LLN skills.

Behaviours that may indicate a learner needs support in LLN include:

-   Constantly checking instructions with peers or repeatedly checking instructions with you
-   Rarely finishing work
-   Appearing confused and asking unrelated questions
-   Not answering the question asked
-   Having difficulty following instructions
-   Acting compliantly, nodding agreement but not doing what is expected
-   Copying material without ‘processing’ it.

Other behaviours which may indicate a learner requires LLN support include the following:

| Reading                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Writing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Oral Communication                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Numeracy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Showing signs of hesitation, confusion, fear or anger while reading  Reading very slowly, frequently pausing to re-read work  Asking what a simple sentence or paragraph means  Not wanting to take or use printed material  Getting someone else to read a form  Avoiding activities where reading may be required  | Poor handwriting, e.g. shaky letters not shaped properly  Copying information incorrectly from one place to another  Not filling in answers to essential questions on forms  Very slow writing; pausing to re-check work  Needing to copy letters or words from another document to avoid errors  Wanting to take forms home to fill out, "when I can think about it" | Getting words out of order  Carrying out an instruction incorrectly Having difficulty answering questions, needing prompts  Asking the speaker to repeat what they have said or to talk slower  Avoiding speaking up; staying quiet, staying in the background  Being unable to concentrate for long when someone is talking to them | Getting confused and easily distracted when counting  Unable to read large numbers  Avoiding tasks involving mathematical calculations and processes  Refusing to calculate without a calculator  Not contributing to problem-solving  Not writing answers until the answers have been worked out for everyone |

**Discussion with learner:** Encourage the learner to identify their LLN needs through conversation. Some people will be prepared to tell you what help they need, at least in general terms. For example, “I get stuck when I have to fill out the new work ticket”. Observing behaviours during the conversation will also assist.

People are generally not good at judging their own communication skills. They usually over-estimate their ability. Learners may also feel embarrassed about their levels of LLN and try to hide any difficulties they are having. It is important to establish a good rapport with your learner to encourage them to feel comfortable enough to disclose any LLN issues.

## Spiky profile

The term ‘Spiky profile’, as stated by the ACSF, is the recognition that a person’s performance level may vary between core skills or within a core skill between different *Domains of Communication*. A person may also display a spiky profile across different focus areas and different text types.

Using the ACSF, an individual’s performance across the five core skills are benchmarked and a spiky profile constructed. This provides valuable information about an individual’s areas of strength and specifically identifies any areas where further training could be beneficial.

For a more detailed look at how to create a Spiky Profile view the [Australian Core Skills Framework](https://docs.employment.gov.au/documents/australian-core-skills-framework)[^21], giving particular attention to the section “*The ACSF in Action”* where the use of the ACSF and the concept of spiky profiles through a range of scenarios is illustrated.

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|

## Activity 25.1: Use an ACSF assessment tool

-   Choose a validated LLN assessment tool from [Precision Consultancy](http://www.precisionconsultancy.com.au/acs_framework/)[^22] similar to a task your learners may have to complete in a workplace
-   Print the assessment tool
-   Read through the assessment tool. Note the ACSF core skill levels being assessed in the tool
-   Ask a student undertaking the TAELLN411 unit with you to complete this LLN assessment
-   Determine the LLN skills of this student
-   Compare the LLN skills of this student to the LLN skills required to complete the unit of competency or benchmark.

[^22]: <http://www.precisionconsultancy.com.au/acs_framework/>

**Note**: This is a practice opportunity only. Your TAELLN411 assessment requires you to use a validated assessment tool with a vocational learner with real LLN needs.

# Cultural and equity considerations

## Social considerations

For many individuals requiring LLN support, this can be a source of intense embarrassment and shame for them. They often feel judged by society as being “dumb” or “lazy” when the reality is often, they faced significant social barriers during their education and were not afforded the necessary support. Typically, the education system has let these individuals down, rather than their LLN skills being weak through any fault of their own.

These previously negative experiences with formal education can significantly impact the behaviour of these students when engaging with VET, affecting everything from their confidence and self-efficacy to relationships with their teachers and peers. They will often be reluctant to share that they have support needs and may be very good at hiding these needs through a complex series of work arounds that they have developed over time. Often their support needs will be complex and their capacity to engage with this support may be limited due to other obligations such as childcare, mental health concerns, work commitments or disability. These limitations to engage with support can further negatively impact their confidence.

It can be useful to communicate information in small chunks before working up to more complex information. Where a student has weak writing skills, they will rely on their memory and while they will often have an astoundingly good memory, smaller chunks are still easier to recall and process. Some students will prefer to work in small groups for the additional support, but others may find this intimidating – find out the preferences of your students. Working through examples of the content as a class group before providing group or individual practice opportunities and leaving those worked examples available for future reference can be useful as students master new skills. Where the training can be related to the immediate tasks and roles they need to perform, the increased relevance will help students maintain high levels of engagement.

## Cultural considerations

A person’s culture gives them a sense of identity and has often been formed from an early age. It includes customs and beliefs. As a trainer and assessor, you need to be aware of other cultures and sensitive to the impact this might have on training and assessment. Here are some examples of cultural variations:

-   A lack of eye contact may be a sign of respect in some cultures and be considered rude in others
-   Some cultures may not value vocational education for all family members
    -   The learner might like a family member or partner to be involved in the discussion regarding the training and assessment to be undertaken
    -   This can help the learner gain the support of significant people in their home environment
-   Some cultures are collaborative, and learners may not like to be singled out
-   Hand gestures can mean dramatically different things in different cultures
-   A loud, expressive voice might not mean someone is angry.

When scheduling training and assessment, be mindful of religious obligations, which could preclude the learner from participating at a particular time or in a particular way. For example:

-   Observing religious days
-   Fasting at certain times of the year
-   Consuming certain food may not be permitted
-   Being assessed in front of other candidates may be confronting for some candidates.

Some suggestions for being sensitive to cultural considerations include:

-   Dress modestly
-   Respect cultures, even if they are different from your own
-   Ensure learning materials are free from cultural bias, cultural jargon and are sensitive
-   Ask the candidate about any cultural considerations you need to be aware of
-   Undertake cultural research
-   Include storytelling as a training and assessment strategy
-   Give students adequate time to prepare for oral questions and discussions
-   Ensure privacy and confidentiality is maintained
-   Avoid scheduling assessments during religious holidays
-   Review materials to ensure they are free of sensitive or controversial views
-   Ensure equity for all learners/candidates
-   Providing culturally diverse students an opportunity to ask for the supports that would best help them

In some instances an interpreter may be available and appropriate, however these services can be difficult to access and expensive. Unless detailed and nuanced understanding is critical to maintaining the rights of the student, it is typical that other strategies are pursued before interpreter services are engaged. The exception to this is Auslan interpreters.

# LLN support

LLN support may include:

-   Resources to develop the LLN skills of the learner
-   Specialist LLN support.

There are various resources freely available on the web to help build the LLN skills of the learner. There will be times when you will need to seek specialist LLN support. An **LLN specialist** is a person who holds **appropriate qualifications** to deliver language, literacy and numeracy training. They include but are not limited to:

-   Adult Language, Literacy, and Numeracy Practitioners
-   Adult Language, Literacy, and Numeracy Specialists
-   English as a Second Language Teachers (ESL)
-   English for Speakers of Other Languages Teachers (ESOL).

These teachers hold a:

-   Postgraduate qualifications in Adult Language, Literacy and Numeracy
-   Tertiary qualifications in Teaching English as a Second or Other Language
-   Vocational graduate qualifications in Adult Language, Literacy and Numeracy.

LLN specialists can support vocational trainers in planning, designing and evaluating training by:

-   Analysing the LLN requirements in training packages, competency standards, workplace practices and in-house training programs
-   Identifying implications of LLN issues for assessment tasks
-   Identifying any specialist LLN training, if required
-   Finding appropriate and authentic resources within the workplace that they can use in training and assessment
-   Developing customised training materials and assessment tools
-   Checking assessment tasks for appropriateness of language, literacy and numeracy demands
-   Co-delivering training where the LLN expert works with the trainer in delivering and facilitating face-to-face training
-   Team teaching, with the LLN expert moving throughout the class to assist students, while the vocational teacher delivers training in a regular way
-   Providing one-to-one or small group LLN support training when the LLN needs of the learners are more intensive. This specialist training may take place concurrently with the vocational training.

## Specialist LLN programs

There are a number of specialist LLN support programs offered through TAFE.

**Note**: Not all of these will be available on every TAFE NSW campus.

### Job-seeking students

The Skills for Education and Employment (SEE) program[^23] is external for students who are registered as job seekers with Centrelink or Job Seeker Agencies (JSAs). Centrelink and JSAs refer clients to the program through the VET online system. Appointments are made with the Career Pathways and Employability Skills staff. The learner undertakes a one and a half hour LLN assessment based on the ACSF, then a detailed report on the student’s performance is written by the LLN practitioner. Students can then access ten to twenty hours of LLN training per week and up to 650 hours in total. After every 100 hours of training, a smaller assessment is undertaken to determine the LLN outcomes achieved.

[^23]: <https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/skills-education-and-employment>

### Working students

A working student not eligible for Centrelink and the SEE program may be able to access LLN training at a local campus. Talk to your local Career Pathways and Employability Skills teaching staff about what might be available at your campus.

### Foundation skills– study centres

Study centres are available at different times at a number of campuses. The study centres provide students with support in accessing computers, study and writing skills, writing bibliographies and career planning. They may facilitate support for students studying a variety of courses. Foundation skills courses may also be offered that cover the full range of the core skills.

### RU Ready – student cohorts

TAFE assesses students before or after enrolment using the RU Ready online assessment tool developed in the UK. The program is mapped against the ACSF and identifies existing skill gaps that need addressing. This can be used to assess students enrolled through any skills team. Talk to your local Head Teacher to be referred to the RU Ready Co-ordinator.

To complete an RU Ready assessment, each student logs into a computer and works through ten initial questions. The assessment can take up to one and a half hours to complete the English and Maths components. A report is automatically generated with the ACSF level the student achieved. A Career Pathways and Employability Skills teacher checks and analyses the results then discusses the report with the vocational teacher to determine support requirements.

### Team teaching

Career Pathways and Employability Skills staff can provide team teaching and tutorial support for a vocational cohort. This support can vary from two hours per week, up to 15 hours per week. Talk to your local Head Teacher about the options.

## Internal Resources

Your RTO may have a range of resources to support you and your students. Examples may include:

-   Professional development
-   Online learning and development intranet portal
-   Communities of practice
-   LLN specialist, practitioner or support team

## Other community programs

There are a number of specialist LLN support programs within the community, which are supported by the government. These include, but not limited to, the following:

[Adult migrant English program](https://www.education.gov.au/adult-migrant-english-program-0)[^24]: This program provides up to 1000 hours of free English lessons to eligible adult migrants and humanitarian entrants.

[^24]: <https://www.education.gov.au/adult-migrant-english-program-0>

[Reading Writing Hotline 1300 6555 06](https://www.readingwritinghotline.edu.au/information-and-advice/)[^25]**:** This is a free national telephone adult literacy and numeracy referral service funded by the Australian Government Department of Education and Training and managed by TAFE NSW.

[^25]: <https://www.readingwritinghotline.edu.au/information-and-advice/>

[Ideas that Work](https://www.ideasthatwork.com.au/): is a series of videos designed to assist trainers to support LLn needs in their classroom. It covers the full range of core skills

# Customising for LLN

The training and assessment materials you normally use may require customising for learners with low LLN skills.

Learners may be as competent at the skills component of vocational training as any other student, but may be challenged by any associated:

-   Reading
-   Writing
-   Oral communication
-   Numeracy
-   Learning.

Some strategies to customise materials and learning resources include:

-   Write in plain English, preferably addressing the learner directly (that is, using words like 'you').
-   Use a 12 point, clear font, short concise sentences and spaces between paragraphs.
-   Chunk the learning material into separate topics and ideas with extensive use of subheadings
-   Explain all jargon and technical terms when you use them for the first time.
-   Break up complex paragraphs in bulleted lists where possible.
-   Include lots of graphics, diagrams and photos to support the text.
-   Keep the layout clear and simple and include a lot of white space.
-   Use short statements instead of full sentences on slides
-   Highlight key words (using bolding or a different colour).
-   Present one idea per slide
-   Make sure the text on slides is large enough to be read easily at the back of the room
-   Avoid too much text on a single slide.
-   Use images to illustrate the text and keep the slides interesting.
-   Avoid complex background designs and make sure the background colour provides a high contrast with the text.

You can reduce the requirement for LLN skills by customising your training and assessment materials.

## Examples

Compare the following versions of a Hairdressing Class Agreement.

**Version one**

**HAIRDRESSING CLASS AGREEMENT**

In consideration of the Managing Director agreeing at my request to arrange for the following work namely hair-dressing beauty culture and/or allied work to be performed on my person by students and/or trainees of TAFECOM or some or one of them I the undersigned acknowledge that I am aware that the said students and/or trainees are not qualified to perform such work AND I AGREE that any such work so performed by such students and/or trainees or some of one of them including bleaching tinting and colouring permanent waving by any process whether or not entailing the application of sachets and/or heaters to my hair shall be performed entirely at my own risk AND I FURTHER AGREE that Her Majesty the Queen Her Heirs and Successors the Minister the Government of the State of New South Wales and the Director-General and their servants and agents or any of them shall not be held liable for any injury to person or damage to property whatsoever which I or any other person may suffer either (i) in the course of or as a result of the performance of the aforesaid work and/or (ii) in the course of or as a result of entering leaving passing through traversing or using in any way whatsoever any premises or buildings or grounds or any part of or parts thereof under the care control and management of Her Majesty the Queen Her Heirs and Successors or the Government of the said State or the Minister or the Managing Director and each of them and their servants and agents and each of them whether such injury or damage be attributable to lack of skill or care defective equipment or premises the nature or quality of the materials used or any other cause whatsoever AND I FURTHER AGREE to release and indemnify Her Majesty Her Heirs and Successors the Government of the State of New South Wales the Minister the Managing Director and their servants and agents and each of them the said students and trainees and each of them and their instructors and each of them and to hold them harmless and free from all claims demands action suits cause or causes of action or suit sum or sums of money compensation damage costs charges and expenses which I or any other person or persons at any time hereafter may have or but for this writing might have against Her Majesty the Queen Her Heirs and Successors the said Government of the State of New South Wales the Minister the Managing Director or their agents or servants or any of them or the said students or trainees or any of them or their instructors or any of them for or on account of the matters before specified or for or on account of any other matter or thing caused by or arising out of same.

For the purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires 'Minister' means that the Minister for Education of the State of New South Wales and includes his successors in office. 'Managing Director' means the Managing Director of TAFECOM for the State of New South Wales or the person acting as such for the time being.

**Version two**

**HAIRDRESSING AND BEAUTY THERAPY AGREEMENT**

I agree to have the following work done by the students of hairdressing and Beauty Therapy at ………………………………………..… Campus of TAFE NSW.

I agree and understand that:

I may have to stay in the class for the whole lesson.

The students are training and may not yet be qualified to do the work.

The students may have to use cutting tools, heated equipment, bleaches, tints, colours and other chemicals on my hair, nails or skin.

Any work is done at my own risk.

I must accept the teacher’s advice on the suitability of the work I want done.

I cannot claim any costs for injury or damage to myself or my property either while the work is being done or after it has been completed. This injury or damage could be due to lack of skill, defective equipment, the quality of materials or some other cause.

TAFE and its students and employees are not liable for any injury or damage I might suffer while I’m at the Campus.

**I HAVE READ THIS INDEMNITY AGREEMENT AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS.**

### Analysis

The second version is much easier to read as it has used:

-   White space in the document
-   A plain font, in an appropriate size
-   Information in bite-sized pieces
-   Language familiar in the workplace and to the learner.

# LLN learning strategies

General strategies to support learning and LLN needs include the following.

![Learning](media/adeac56a8d61f043a474e29c69d10df7.png)

-   Allowing more time to undertake the learning
-   Using technology such as YouTube to make learning more engaging
-   Creating games to make learning fun. For example, using a matching game to introduce industry terminology with definitions
-   Translating general concepts and skills into workplace-specific functions and tasks
-   Starting the unit by using language familiar to the learner and building on the vocabulary of the learners
-   Providing definitions and explanations, which give context when introducing new and unfamiliar content
-   Linking new content to previous knowledge
-   Providing completed models of documents learners need to read and write. For example, incident forms or customer order forms
-   Giving an overview of the course or training session to enable students to see how the small parts all fit together.
-   Breaking text into smaller chunks to reduce the possibility of overwhelming learners
-   Developing activities that use several methods of communication appropriate to the workplace. For example, having learners read and discuss, read and write, listen and record
-   Using structured activities
-   Using simplified case studies
-   Using co-operative learning approaches which involve the experience of other students
-   Using a variety of methods to reinforce the learning
-   Providing specific praise on work the learner does well.

![Reading](media/06b9c852d0dd369ea8ae8967e72b50d1.png)

-   Use plain English that is appropriate for the learner.
-   Use audio recordings of texts, provide a transcript if necessary.
-   Introduce industry-specific vocabulary, technical terminology and mathematical concepts before presenting reading material.
-   Develop a glossary of specific terminology and their meanings.
-   Divide reading assignments into chunks so that individual students can read a section, and then report back to the whole group.
-   Discuss with students’ strategies for dealing with complex reading tasks (e.g. discussing which sections to read first, scanning headings or highlighting key sections).
-   Rewrite complex material to a level that matches the students’ capabilities. Use plain English, break up long paragraphs of text and simplify the layout.
-   When students are learning how to operate equipment to manufacturers’ specifications, show them where to find and how to read these specifications.
-   Replace or supplement reading material with visual resources such as diagrams, photographs or videos.
-   Ensure lots of white space on each page.
-   Use colour to make your resources visually enticing.
-   Use plain font.

![Writing](media/dac9884d928a2267470203a86a194dd9.png)

-   Discuss with the group the different types of writing required for different purposes, e.g. note-taking, data collection or report writing.
-   Encourage peer support, e.g. peer proofreading, pair work or buddy groups.
-   Reinforce written materials with visuals – e.g. a diagram, photograph or a demonstration.
-   Provide English language and first language vocabulary for key words to ESL students in upper and lowercase letters. Allow time for practise.
-   Offer some basic strategies for developing accuracy in spelling, e.g. Look–Say–Cover–Check, or assist leaner to develop a personal dictionary of regularly needed words (with visual prompts).
-   Offer examples of the different types of writing as a model that students can refer to later if necessary, e.g. a filled out safety checklist, an accident report form or a field trip report.
-   When you provide a scaffold, discuss the various the layout features of the text with the student, such as:
    -   headings and sub-headings
    -   linking words for paragraphs when writing explanatory information e.g. and, but, then, however
    -   sequencing words for writing a factual account e.g. first, then, next
    -   stock phrases for making contrasting points when presenting an argument, e.g. on the other hand, the points against are.
-   Be aware of, and explicitly demonstrate the drafting process: planning, drafting, editing and proofreading and preparing final copy.
-   Build independence by providing less ‘scaffolding’ and encouraging more and more student independence as they gain in experience and skill.
-   Help students marshal their thoughts and organise what they want to write by leading a ‘group brainstorm’ on a whiteboard then structure and order the content to suit the type of text and style of writing required.

![Oral Communication](media/180d55925bc400a91c3dc00726dc1102.png)

-   Discuss the various types of speaking and listening required in the training and on-the-job. Discuss with the group the features of ‘getting your message across’ and ‘understanding what someone else is saying’.
-   Cover key words, terms and phrases (based on written texts) that may be unfamiliar to the student.
-   Point out that terms have different meanings in different contexts e.g. a baker makes a cookie, an IT technician disables ‘cookies’ on a computer, a carpenter uses a ‘cookie’ to splice two bits of wood together.
-   List and explain colloquialisms or avoid colloquial language (unless it is clear they are fully understood by the listener).
-   Use gesture and intonation (stress on certain words in a sentence, rise and fall of voice) to indicate the key points.
-   Repeat key ideas and learning points using the same language each time to give students an additional opportunity for understanding.
-   Assist students to practise giving factual reports by providing a ‘scaffold script’ (similar to the points covered in writing). Adjust these for the spoken word.
-   Use clear, unambiguous language.
-   Speak naturally but at a moderate pace.
-   Don’t raise your speaking level for people who don’t speak English as a first language or make them feel ‘stupid’ if they don’t understand or need to ask questions.
-   Give instructions or feedback using signposting, e.g. ‘I am going to talk about three areas. The first ...’.
-   Highlight key points and terms on the whiteboard in a training room situation to reinforce oral explanations and a visual cue to students.
-   Use pictures, diagrams and demonstration to support verbal information.
-   Students may have highly developed listening skills in other languages, but may be restricted in using these skills because of difficulty with English.
-   Vocational trainers and assessors can help students to extract relevant information by:
    -   avoiding long periods of teacher explanation
    -   giving a handout with the main points or questions before students listen
    -   providing question sheets or tick boxes to complete when listening
    -   asking ‘checking for meaning’ questions to elicit a demonstration of comprehension
    -   avoiding closed yes/no questions such as ‘Do you understand?’
    -   allowing students to summarise or discuss what they have listened to in pairs and ask questions before moving on.

![Numeracy](media/2f35ddd16da6ad75036a96fbe63080d7.png)

-   Discuss with students the importance of number in their lives. Discuss different cultural uses for the use of number. Discuss the reasons for using numeracy within the training and the skills required on the job.
-   Encourage peer support, e.g. by asking another student to explain the method.
-   Revise the four basic functions – addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (according to the demand for use within the training program).
-   Introduce the language of number, e.g. there are many ways to say ‘multiply’, such as ‘times’, ‘by’, ‘product’.
-   Ensure that students understand the ‘command words ’of problems, e.g. solve, evaluate, identify and estimate.
-   Check students are familiar with number as numerals and words, e.g. 6 and SIX.
-   Use a variety of teaching strategies to meet the different learning styles of students to maintain their interest keep it practical and based on the task at hand.
-   Offer different methods for solving problems – not assuming that there is only one way to do it (e.g. there are at least four ways of doing subtraction). Be careful to avoid confusing in presenting different problem solving approaches.
-   New topics involving numeracy skills should be taught in short logical steps. Do not assume that students achieving correct answers ‘on paper’ necessarily understand a process or concept in practise.
-   Ask students how they were taught to do calculations, and check they have opportunities to select methods they feel comfortable with (but check that they are using a method that gives them the chance of arriving at a reasonable answer).
-   Use direct teaching strategies to develop new skills, e.g. direct attention to key points, demonstrate, model, explain and illustrate, question and discuss.
-   Design paper-based exercises that are relevant to the practical task and give students opportunities to practise and reinforce the skills learned in practise.
-   Use practical aids, such as calculators, but ensure students understand the limitations and functions of a calculator.
-   Check students are familiar with tools to measure length and volume, such as tape measures (mm, cm and m) and measuring jugs (mls, L).

Other useful strategies include:

-   introducing key industry and technical terminology
-   scaffolding students’ access to complex texts by chunking or rewriting some texts, providing oral support, paraphrasing and by dictation; the student is supported in understanding complex texts by the facilitator breaking the information into smaller sections of the original text
-   modelling text types common in the industry
-   introducing specific text types or genres used in the industry and teaching their linguistic structures and providing opportunities to rehearse their use in a low-risk environment
-   simulating report writing in course activities, where report writing is a requirement
-   Plan what you will write on the whiteboard so that it makes progressive, logical sense
-   Provide a schedule or agenda on the board that you can tick off as the session progresses.

As a facilitator, you can provide students with strategies to enhance or build their core skills. You might suggest that they:

-   Come prepared to class with appropriate learning materials
-   Ask questions and ask for re-explanations when they need clarification on any topic
-   Use the spell checker on a computer
-   Work with someone in the group who can help them with specific tasks
-   Practice their reading, writing, numeracy or oral communication skills doing other things like chatting to people at the shops, reading a magazine or keeping a home budget on an excel spreadsheet
-   Set learning goals and celebrate achievements.

You can design learning activities that will give students an opportunity to practise their core skills in a relevant context. You could ask them to:

-   Make their own list of important, subject-specific words
-   Add labels to diagrams and pictures to help them remember key terminology
-   Discuss their reading with others
-   Work in a group to identify different methods for solving numerical problems.

You can encourage students to participate in training sessions by asking questions like:

-   Did I explain that clearly?
-   I noticed that you didn’t answer when I said…
-   Can I say that another way?

# LLN assessment strategies

Assessment tasks must accurately assess **competence** and meet the **principles of assessment**. To be valid, reliable, flexible and fair, they must allow the candidate to demonstrate all the required skills.

The assessment tasks require the same level of LLN skills as the unit of competency and the workplace application. The LLN skills required by the assessment method should not become a barrier to the candidate, preventing them from demonstrating competence. Providing additional support to candidates during training and before undertaking their assessment will help prepare the learner for the assessment.

You may be required to apply **reasonable adjustments** to the assessment task. Reasonable adjustments are those that:

Do not

-   cause the provider (assessor/RTO) unjustifiable hardship
-   harm other candidates
-   invalidate the standards of the training specification

Can reasonably be

-   expected within a workplace
-   transferred to the workplace.

Strategies that can be used to modify assessments appropriately include:

-   Using observation where the learner can demonstrate competency in a practical way
-   Breaking assessments into smaller components and assess throughout the course. This builds up skill level rather than assessing everything at the end, potentially overwhelming the learner
-   Using short questions in plain English with one task per question
-   Using reading aids, for example, JAWs
-   Providing a scribe
-   Where oral communication is strong, allowing the student to answer verbally
-   Allowing more time to complete the assessment
-   Any of the strategies that apply to learning resources can also be applied to assessment resources.
-   Extend or modify timeframes for assessment
-   Consider the impact of the type of assessment task on the student
-   Present information in a range of media (increases accessibility)
-   Seek evidence from a third party to demonstrate competence (statutory declaration, video of the student undertaking a task)
-   Ensure the language of assessment instruments does not create barriers (use plain English).
-   Use generic terms when constructing assessment tasks, for example, use ‘communicate’, ‘present’, ‘create’ instead of ‘speak’, ‘talk’, ‘listen’, ‘look’, ‘draw’ and ‘write’ (inclusive language)
-   Provide sufficient feedback on the progress of individual students regarding their learning goals.

# Evaluation and review

This takes place during the delivery and after.

What are you evaluating and review? Well you want to know if the strategies you put into place to support your learner with LLN issues are working or if they have worked.

You want to review and evaluate the following

-   delivery strategies
-   assessment strategies
-   customised resources
-   other support such as LLN specialist or specialist services

In order to review and evaluate the above you need feedback and you can get feedback from:

-   the learners themselves
    -   you could ask them or observe them in class
    -   Getting them to complete an anonymous feedback – this gives more honest answers
-   Your colleagues and line manager
    -   Asking them
    -   Getting them to review your resources and discuss your delivering strategies
-   LLN specialist or any of the support services you used
    -   Discussions with the LLN specialist
    -   For the LLN support services, such as web sites you may want to ask learners how valuable these were
-   Self-reflection
    -   Think about delivery and assessment strategies and the resources you used and review and evaluate how well these worked in the sessions.

# Introduction to the Deliver Cluster

Welcome to your next cluster in yourTAE40116 Certificate IV in Training and Assessment – the deliver cluster.

You will develop the skills necessary to deliver training in both a workplace context and in a classroom context. This will include

-   Developing and delivering a workplace learning pathway
-   Providing workplace coaching
-   Delivering learning programs in a classroom context

# Work-based Learning

Work based learning is a very common and important aspect of the VET sector. It includes everything from the formal training activities undertaken by Learning and Development Teams in large organisations through to the orientation given to the new kid starting a job at the local fish and chip shop. It includes professional development workshops and coaching on executive leadership skills and leaning over to Gladys to ask her to show you how she does that fancy thing in Microsoft Word.

Workplace learning:

-   Uses real work activities as the basis for learning
-   Analyse work practices and routines to determine their effectiveness in meeting the learning objectives
-   Learning in the workplace
-   Integrates external learning with work-based learning
-   May not only focus on the learner’s current role but also future roles.

It is certain that you would have participated in work-based learning at some point in your career. Some of these experiences may have been positive, and others less so.

Work-based learning (WBL) in vocational education and training is learning that occurs in real work environments through participation in authentic work activities and interactions. Work-based learning is a central tenet of VET, because it emphasises learning through practice in the workplace.

Work-based learning is embedded in the curriculum and can involve deliberate engagement with those experiences for learning purposes and the formal recognition of the competencies achieved through those experiences.

There are several different approaches to work-based learning in VET. In some models, the learner is an employee who is located in the workplace more than in the classroom, which contrasts with other models where learners are primarily students in education and training providers, with only some time spent in the workplace or undertaking work-related projects. Types of work- based learning include:

-   Apprenticeships and traineeships (including pre-apprenticeship programs) are a well-known form of work-based learning. Indeed, they are often considered the ‘prototype’ for work-based learning. Apprenticeships are high-intensity and high-frequency forms of work-based learning, such that the learner spends most of their time in the workplace, where they acquire most of their skills. Most apprenticeships and traineeships are generally two to four years in length.
-   Simulation provides experiential learning experiences, whereby students are engaged in analysis and decision-making in real work situations in an educational setting. Simulations are most effective and beneficial to students when they are considered to be a ‘realistic’ experience of the workplace or the commercial environment. In VET, simulated work environments can include:
    -   trading or simulated businesses operated by the training provider (such as TAFE restaurants for hospitality students)
    -   campus-based training sites (such as workshops for trade students, greenhouses for horticulture students, and salons for hairdressing students)
    -   technology-assisted simulation (such as train and flight simulators)
    -   structured role play of work situations (such as the use of mannequins for nursing students).
-   Placements immerse students into a workplace for a period of time and can be known by other terms, for example, service learning. Placements, which can vary in length, can be a requirement of the course or be optional. For example, a 120-hour minimum work requirement is now compulsory for certificate III and IV courses in personal care.
-   Orientation and Induction programs have become commonplace for organisations of all sizes. While these programs will vary in terms of their formality and level of detail, they can be critical for an organisation to demonstrate due care towards and employee in case of an accident and incident. Typically orientation and induction programs will cover role administration such as pay, leave and work conditions, performance expectations, safety, emergency procedures, culture and values and workplace specific skills to perform the role
-   Professional development can be both formal and informal and may sit outside of the range of training products that are nationally recognised. Often professional development programs will be developed against specific and individual learning needs and will include a range of learning activities that may include autonomous learning, coaching, mentoring and workshops.

    WBL can be highly valuable to students because the integration with the work environment means a very high level of relevance to the student’s job role. This can lead the increased engagement. In many cases, the student’s manager will also be engaged with the training program either as a stakeholder being consulted, providing feedback on the student’s progress or assessing the final outcomes that the student achieves against business needs. Where the engagement from the manager is constructive and the relationship is positive, this can be an important factor in supporting the student in their learning. Of course, where the relationship is fraught or the manager’s engagement is not constructive, this involvement can also be detrimental to the student’s development.

    WBL is often highly contextualised to the specific needs and work context of the employer. Whilst an employer may wish to underpin a WBL program with training products to provide their team members with nationally recognised outcomes, this is not always the case. Often the employer is more interested in the workplace skills than the national recognised skill set or qualification and has no wish to put team members through such a rigorous assessment process to have these outcomes recognised.

    WBL programs may be developed for a range of reasons. Some reasons include:

-   New technology or equipment
-   Professional development for individuals prior to promotion
-   Address poor performance
-   Legislative or licensing changes
-   Introduction of a new product or service
-   Changes in strategy or culture of the organisation
-   Addressing identified skills gaps

## 

## 70:20:10 model of work-based learning

The 70:20:10 model attempts to describe the breakdown of different learning activities that occur in work-based learning. The model suggests that a lot of the learning that occurs in the workplace is informal with 70% of knowledge and skills coming from workplace experiences. It suggests that approximately 20% comes from interactions with others and 10% from formal instruction.

The 70-20-10 model is considered to be of greatest value as a general guideline for organizations seeking to maximize the effectiveness of their learning, and development programs through activities and inputs other than formal training. The model opens up a range of learning and development activities that can be just as valuable as formal instruction but may be overlooked when putting together a learning pathway for an individual or a team.

![](media/ca12ee1631b750a0171a271540540d8b.png)[^30]

[^30]: https://instructionaldesign.com.au/the-702010-learning-model/

The model’s creators hold that hands-on experience (the 70%) is the most beneficial for employees because it enables them to discover and refine their job-related skills, make decisions, address challenges, and interact with influential people such as bosses and mentors within work settings. They also learn from their mistakes and receive immediate feedback on their performance.

Employees learn from others (the 20%) through a variety of activities that include social learning, coaching, mentoring, collaborative learning, and other methods of interaction with peers. Encouragement and feedback are prime benefits of this valuable learning approach.

The formula holds that only 10% of professional development optimally comes from formal traditional courseware instruction and other educational events, a position that typically surprises practitioners from academic backgrounds.

It should be noted that these ratios are approximate and will differ between industries, organisations, and individuals. The key argument that formal learning is only a small proportion of workplace learning generally holds true in most settings.

# Analysing work practices

To implement effective work-based training, you will need a thorough understanding of the job roles and functions within the workplace and how they align with the training benchmarks.

Training benchmarks can be non-accredited, such as undertaking tasks according to a workplace procedure or can be accredited units of competency.

-   Review the job descriptions of the learners undertaking the training
-   Review the organisation’s policies and procedures
-   Review the organisational structure
-   Arrange a tour of the organisation and observe how the work is conducted
-   Discuss with supervisors and learners the work practices
-   Check whether the training can be conducted safely in the workplace. For example, teaching a learner how to operate a forklift in a busy depot may put the learner and others at risk. Basic skills may need mastering in an environment dedicated to learning before using the forklift in a crowded depot.
-   Consider how the training could impact other workers. The learner will need to be able to concentrate on the training. To avoid disruptions to training, some of the learner’s usual tasks may need to be delegated to others during the training period. The learner may need to be rostered on with particular employees or at particular times to take advantage of the opportunity for a more experienced worker to mentor the learner. Alternatively, this may allow the learner to train or be assessed in a work task that is only undertaken during certain shifts
-   Undertaking a task break down will assist you in designing training for specific tasks.

### Discussing work practices with the supervisor

Discussing the work practices with the workplace supervisor will lead to relevant work-based training. Questions you may ask include:

-   Are there any work practices you feel need improvement?
-   What are the strengths and weaknesses of the learners?
-   Has succession planning been undertaken? What career paths are available to the learners?
-   Are trends emerging in the industry that may be adopted by the organisation and require staff training?
-   Can you explain the workflow in the organisational structure?
-   Who could be a suitable mentor, buddy or coach for the learner? Can rostering be organised to enable the learner to shadow more experienced staff members?
-   Are there any contractual or industrial relations requirements that may affect the training? Workplace agreements may dictate hours of work or restrict workplace tasks to specific roles. For example, there are restrictions in the health industry regarding who can administer medication and give injections.

### Discussing work practices with the learner

Questions you may ask the learner include:

-   How closely does the job description reflect your actual day-to-day work activities? Are there any additional tasks you perform?
-   What are your strengths and weaknesses in conducting work tasks?
-   What are your career goals? Reviewing the learner’s past experience may reveal skills that, when combined with their current role, indicate a potential pathway.

Undertake a training needs analysis to determine the skill levels of the learner. The training needs analysis can range from a survey, asking the learner to rank their ability or how often they perform the tasks, to a pre-training assessment that requires the learner to answer questions or undertake a task. Pre-training assessments or checking with their supervisor is useful because learners may underestimate or overestimate their abilities.

## Capability development

Work-based training is really about capability development, where you consider the learner’s job roles in the:

-   Past (what the learner has done)
-   Present (what they are currently required to do)
-   Future (what they would like to be doing).

You compare this to the analysis of the job roles in the organisation, to determine development requirements.

# Identifying skills gaps

A training needs analysis is often conducted as a first step in developing a training program and will rely on a lot of the information you gathered as part of your analysis of work practices. The outcomes of your training needs analysis will inform not only the training design but also the way the program is evaluated to determine the success of the training program’s execution.

A training needs analysis aims to answer three different questions:

-   What skills does an individual need to perform this role/task effectively?
-   What skill/s does this individual already have that contribute to being able to perform this role/task effectively?
-   What skills are lacking or absent that the individual will need before they will be able to perform this role/task effectively?

    You can consider these questions as a simple gap analysis:

-   Where is the student?
-   Where does the student need to be?
-   What does the student need to do to get from here to there?

    A training needs analysis can be conducted at a range of different levels; it can be conducted at an organisational level for instance to determine the readiness of an organisation to respond to a critical incident or implement a change in strategic direction, it can be performed at a team level to determine the capability of a team to adapt to a change in computer system, or it can be conducted at an individual level.

    There will be a broad range of factors that will need to be considered when ascertaining the expected skills of the role/task. Some of these will include:

-   Organisational and cultural expectations
-   Manager’s expectations
-   Team expectations
-   Demands from workplace changes

    Some of this information will be found in documents such as job descriptions, policies, procedures, whilst other information may need to come from interviews, observations, reviews of organisational records such as WHS incident reports, or stakeholder feedback.

    These sources of information may also provide insight into the current skill levels, however additional tools may include work samples, direct observation, review of workplace injuries and incidents, questionnaires, competitive analysis, performance reviews, reviewing KPIs, using an independent consultant and benchmarking.

    From this information, a clear description of the skills needed can be developed to inform the design of a learning program, detailing where the program needs to focus. Such a program would be considered effective if at its conclusion the participant/s were able to perform the role/task in accordance with the expected level of performance.

# Contractual requirements

Work-based training may have contractual requirements, for example, traineeships and apprenticeships. It may be necessary to change how work is done to allow for learning to occur on the job. Grants, government funding and licensing all tend to have contractual requirements.

## Traineeships and apprenticeships

Traineeships and apprenticeships involve a signed:

-   Legally binding agreement
-   Training plan.

There are three main stakeholders:

-   Trainee/apprentice
-   Workplace manager or supervisor
-   RTO representative.

The training plan comprehensively outlines the details of the training to be undertaken. As a trainer, you need to be aware of what is included:

-   Start and end date of each unit of competency to be delivered
-   The training mode
-   Assessment methods
-   Employer confirmation of competency
-   Date RTO decided competency
-   Learning materials
-   Additional support
-   Workplace facilities and equipment to support the training
-   Confirmation the workplace has the range of work to support the on the job component of the training
-   Confirmation of supervision.

Training plans are submitted to the state training authority before training starts.

Training plans are designed to be a living document, with the RTO progressively reporting back to the employer and employers confirming on-the-job competency.

## Grants and government funding

Most grants and government funding require progressive reporting within specific timeframes to demonstrate the use of the funding and outcomes achieved.

Contractual requirements may restrict your delivery timeframes and how you deliver the work-based learning program.

# Roles and responsibilities

Being a trainer can be like being a ringmaster in the circus.

You are responsible for:

-   The other performers
-   What happens in the circus ring
-   What goes on behind the scene.

The learners are the stars of your show and are central to the decisions made.

For training to run smoothly, you need to:

-   Implement careful planning
-   Prepare thoroughly
-   Have an eye for detail.

Successful training involves all stakeholders knowing their roles and responsibilities. With everyone pulling together, the show must go on!

The key stakeholders, when organising training include:

-   You, the trainer
-   Trainer’s manager
-   Client/learner’s manager
-   Your learners
-   Security
-   Training venue.

Each of these stakeholders has roles and responsibilities that need to be addressed for safe, effective, timely and ASQA compliant training to take place.

Assumptions can be incorrect and lead to something being overlooked. Make sure the roles and responsibilities are confirmed with the stakeholders for the training and assessment you are delivering. The roles and responsibilities may change depending on the situation. For example, you may be used to delivering routinely in a classroom that is permanently set up but will need to check access and equipment available when you deliver training or assessment in a workplace.

## Activity 44.1: Roles and responsibilities

For a training session, you may be required to deliver at a workplace. List three questions you could ask the manager to confirm roles and responsibilities.

| Roles and responsibilities                                                                                                                |

# Risks in training

‘Risk is the probability of damage, liability, loss or any other negative occurrence that may have been avoided through pre-emptive action.’ ([Business Dictionary](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/risk.html), 2019)

WHS risk is covered in a separate topic (see chapter 27 WHS). This topic considers the non-WHS risks you need to be aware of in training. These risks may include:

-   Damage to the reputation of an RTO. Reputation can be damaged due to many different reasons, but generally happens due to a lack of planning or quality control. We all know of RTOs where the qualifications they issue are not held in high regard. As learners choose where they wish to undertake their training, it is very important to safeguard the reputation of the RTO. Failing to meet expectations can also damage the RTOs reputation.
-   Risks to RTO registration through not complying with legislative requirements such as those outlined in the Standards for RTOs 2015. Make sure you are aware of your responsibilities in assisting your RTO to meet the legislative requirements.
-   Insufficient resources to adequately train and assess. This can range from not having enough qualified trainers and assessors to not having a venue large enough to cater for demand. A lack of resources, such as insufficient computers for a computer course, will impact learners gaining enough hands-on practice.
-   Competition and marketplace pressure. Learners may have an expectation of how much a course will cost and how long it will take to complete. You may struggle to get sufficient numbers enrolled in your course if competitors offer something more favourable.
-   Changing trends. Learners want current skills. Make sure you are keeping up to date with the trends in your area of expertise.
-   Lack of learner progress. This may be due to design flaws or through not researching your learners adequately.

# Benchmarks and standards

In many instances, nationally recognised training products may not be suitable for work-based training. There may be a poor match between the unit content and the organisational needs, the may be superfluous material in the unit, the assessment burden may be unnecessary or there may not be a unit of competency covering the required skills.

In this instance, alternatives benchmarks need to be found. You will recall from the design cluster that the role of benchmarks and standards to measure student performance against is a key tenet of competency-based training. While units of competency are designed to fulfill that role, if their use is inappropriate the needs for a benchmark still needs to be satisfied.

Benchmarks may be sourced from organisational documentation that sets out the standard and expectations of performance. Some of these documents may include:

-   Job descriptions
-   Safe work method statements
-   Standard operating procedures
-   Operating manuals
-   Job reviews
-   Policies
-   Procedures
-   KPIs
-   Stakeholder feedback reports

# Integrating learning

Integrating external learning with work-based learning will depend on various factors. Deciding what components of training should be done on the job or off the job may depend on:

-   Safety
-   Disruptions – to either the workflow of the business or to the learning
-   Efficiency and cost-effectiveness
-   Convenience.

Imagine learning at an RTO, only to be told in your workplace “We don’t do it that way here”, or having an employer expect you to complete a task you have not learnt yet. This can happen when on-the-job and off-the-job training is not integrated. It can leave the learner feeling frustrated and confused.

Strategies to help you integrate work-based learning include:

-   Discuss with the learner’s supervisor opportunities for learning-specific tasks on the job. Organise a timetable that will allow learning at the RTO to be reinforced with on-the-job application
-   Review the organisation’s procedures, and where possible, allow learners to use these procedures during the RTO training
-   Encourage learners to discuss their organisation’s policies and procedures and how these procedures relate to the basic skills learnt in training
-   Ask learners how they have been using skills learnt at the RTO in their workplace tasks.

## Monitoring

Monitoring external activities with work-based learning pathway involves the following:

-   Observing the learner applying the skills learnt in the workplace
-   Discussing the learner’s progress in applying the skills with the learner’s supervisor
-   Ensuring the supervisor signs the training plan to confirm competency where apprenticeships and trainees are involved.

## Activity 46.1: Integrating work-based learning

For a workplace task:

1.  Undertake a task analysis
2.  Group learning tasks associated with the workplace task into sessions (like the example given in the topic)
3.  Create a basic plan of on the job and off the job training.

# Individualised learning programs

The learner should be at the centre of all decisions made regarding training and assessment. Remember one size does not fit all. Trainers need to modify training to suit individual learners.

Review the following topics to assist you in planning your training program:

-   Analysing work practices
-   Integrating work-based learning
-   Contractual requirements.

## Documenting the program

Once you have developed your plan for the training, it should be documented and discussed with the stakeholders, including the learner. An individualised learning program or training plan is a requirement for all apprentices and trainees. Documenting and discussing the program should:

-   Clarify the reason for learning
-   Describe the overall objectives
-   Confirm program logistics
-   Identify and confirm stakeholders, their roles and responsibilities
-   Broadly indicate the learning activities, including on the job and off the job components
-   Indicate the assessment method/s
-   Help the learner take responsibility for their own learning.

# Supervision

Adequate supervision of a learner is essential for:

-   WHS for the learner and others in the environment
-   Wellbeing and confidence of the learner.

[Training Services NSW](https://www.training.nsw.gov.au/apprenticeships_traineeships/policy/policy_procedures/supervision_app_trainee_workplace.html) states:

*‘Employers of apprentices and trainees have an obligation to ensure that apprentices and trainees work under the supervision of qualified and experienced workers with relevant skills who are committed to training them.’*

And:

*‘The Apprenticeship/Traineeship Training Contract specifies that an employer must provide the appropriate facilities and experienced people to facilitate the training and supervise the apprentice or trainees while at work.’*

[Section 39 of the Work Health and Safety Regulation 2017](https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/regulation/2017/404/whole) states that:

*‘(1) This clause applies for the purposes of section 19 of the Act to a person conducting a business or undertaking.*

*(2) The person must ensure that information, training and instruction provided to a worker is suitable and adequate having regard to:*

*(a) the nature of the work carried out by the worker, and*

*(b) the nature of the risks associated with the work at the time the information, training or instruction is provided, and*

*(c) the control measures implemented.’*

## How much supervision?

The amount of supervision required will depend on the knowledge, skills and attitude of the learner.

[Training Services NSW](https://www.training.nsw.gov.au/apprenticeships_traineeships/policy/policy_procedures/supervision_app_trainee_workplace.html) gives the following guidance about supervising apprentices and trainees:

*‘It should be reassessed on a regular basis by taking into account the stage the apprenticeship/traineeship is at and the experience and training the apprentice/trainee has received in a particular task.’*

Supervision also enables the supervisor to give feedback and tips to the learner at the time it is most relevant, increasing the likelihood of improvement.

# Ethical behaviour

Ethical behaviour is about doing the right thing. We each have a moral compass about the right and wrong way to act. What is considered ethical can vary between cultures or groups.

Authors Dan Hill, Terry Hill and Lee Perlitz[^33] provide the following guidance for ethical behaviour in training:

[^33]: Dan Hill, Terry Hill, Lee Perlitz Vocational Training and Assessment, A complete course for TAE10, Certificate IV in Training and Assessment.

-   Trust
-   Integrity
-   Privacy and confidentiality
-   Following organisational policies
-   Knowing your limitations
-   Having a range of other interventions and referrals ready when needed
-   Honesty in all actions and dealings
-   Fairness to others.

When you deliver training within organisations, you may be given access to commercial-in-confidence information. This can include access to sensitive data or a method of work that gives the organisation a competitive edge. Access to this information may arise:

-   Through frank discussions with managers as part of establishing the need for training
-   In material supplied to you to help with contextualising your training
-   From learners as they apply the training to their workplace situation.

You must maintain the confidentiality of any workplace in relation to the information you receive.

When trust is established, learners may share personal information that they wish to remain private. Knowing this information can be useful to help remove barriers to training, but it should not become common knowledge. You should offer assistance, but it is the learner’s choice whether they access assistance.

Know your limitations and do not pretend to know all the answers. Refer your learners to others, who are more equipped to deal with the situation, or seek advice if you are out of your depth.

Be aware of any bias you may have and do not make assumptions. Ensure all learners get equal access to participate in the learning. This may mean you need to provide additional support to some learners.

## Activity 50.1: Ethical behaviour

1.  You have been delivering work-based training in an organisation and have built a trusting relationship with your learner. During a session, she reveals she is being bullied at work.

    How would you respond to this?

|   |
|---|

1.  You have been delivering training to an organisation over a number of years. The training has been getting more advanced each time. The organisation hold you in high regard and consider you an expert. You feel like you have got to the stage where you are learning the skills yourself, just before you deliver to the learners.

    What would you do?

|   |
|---|

1.  You have been asked to deliver express training to an organisation. You feel there is not enough time to cover the content in the units of competency properly. The organisation have stressed how important it is that all learners get a competent result at the end of the training.

    What would you do?

|   |

# Learner responsibilities and self-reflection

Learners who take responsibility for their learning and self-reflect are often more engaged and get more from the learning. A learner who is taking responsibility for their learning (for example, in the workplace) may identify learning opportunities aligned to their interests that you may not be aware of.

All learners should be encouraged to self-reflect throughout the training. Through self-reflection, learners can judge their own work performance and make decisions about whether they:

-   Can work independently
-   Require more training, practice or a different approach
-   Are ready to be assessed
-   Would like to advance their skills to the next level.

Techniques learners can use to assess their progress include:

-   Asking other participants for feedback
-   Asking colleagues about specific aspects of their performance
-   Discussing their workplace progress with a workplace supervisor
-   Keeping notes about the things that they did well and ways they could improve.

Your learners may be hesitant to consult with work colleagues to gather feedback about their progress. Complete the activities below to help them.

# Coaching techniques

Coaching in the workplace involves a coach (generally a more experienced staff member, often the line manager) and an employee.

Coaching includes[^34]:

[^34]: https://staff.tafensw.edu.au/documents/2018/10/manager-as-a-coach-approach.pdf/

-   Agreeing on goals and success measures
-   Reflective self-directed learning and professional growth, supported by the coach
-   Direct, goal orientated, personal and often challenging conversations
-   An active collaborative approach.

Coaching staff in the workplace helps many people, including the:

-   Individual being coached
-   Colleagues of the individual
-   Organisation
-   Organisation’s customers.

Successful coaching helps a person realise their ability to learn, achieve and perform, and aids the organisation to achieve its goals. Coaching represents an investment in workplace staff.

## GROW model

The GROW model is a common coaching model as it allows the coach the work with the coachee in such a way that empowers the coachee to take decisive action. It is also not dependent on the coach “knowing the asnwer” or being able to do the task or skill that is being coached. The GROW Model is a simple yet powerful framework for structuring your coaching or mentoring sessions.

GROW stands for:

-   **G**oal.
-   Current **R**eality.
-   **O**ptions (or Obstacles).
-   **W**ill (or Way Forward).

To structure a coaching or mentoring session using the GROW Model, take the following steps:

**1. Establish the Goal**

First, you and your coachee need to look at the behavior that you want to change, and then structure this change as a [goal](https://www.mindtools.com/a5ykiuq/personal-goal-setting) that they want to achieve.

Make sure that this is a [SMART goal](https://www.mindtools.com/a4wo118/smart-goals): one that is Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-bound. We will look at this in more detail in the chapter on Learning Objectives

When doing this, it's useful to ask questions like:

-   How will you know that your coachee has achieved this goal? How will you know that the problem or issue is solved?
-   Does this goal fit with their overall career objectives? And does it fit with the team's objectives?

**2. Examine the Current Reality**

Next, ask your coachee to describe their current reality.

This is an important step. Too often, people try to solve a problem or reach a goal without fully considering their starting point. And often they're missing some information that they need in order to reach their goal effectively.

As your coachee tells you about their current reality, the solution may start to emerge.

Useful coaching questions in this step include the following:

-   What is happening now (what, who, when, and how often)? What is the effect or result of this?
-   Have you already taken any steps toward your goal?
-   Does this goal conflict with any other goals or objectives?

**3. Explore the Options**

Once you and your coachee have explored the current reality, it's time to determine what is possible – meaning all of the possible options for reaching their objective.

Help your coachee [brainstorm](https://www.mindtools.com/acv0de1/brainstorming) as many good options as possible. Then, discuss these and help them decide on the best ones.

By all means, offer your own suggestions in this step but let your coachee offer suggestions first, and let them do most of the talking. It's important to guide them in the right direction, without actually making decisions for them.

Typical questions that you can use to explore options are as follows:

-   What else could you do?
-   What if this or that constraint were removed? Would that change things?
-   What are the advantages and disadvantages of each option?
-   What factors or considerations will you use to weigh the options?
-   What do you need to stop doing in order to achieve this goal?
-   What obstacles stand in your way?

**4. Establish the Will**

By examining the current reality and exploring the options, your coachee will now have a good idea of how they can achieve their goal.

That's great – but in itself, this may not be enough. The final step is to get your coachee to commit to specific actions in order to move forward toward their goal. In doing this, you will help them establish their will and boost their motivation.

Useful questions to ask here include:

-   So, what will you do now, and after that? When? What else will you do?
-   What could stop you moving forward? How will you overcome this?
-   How can you keep yourself motivated?
-   When do you need to review progress? Daily, weekly, monthly?

Finally, decide on a date when you'll both review their progress. This will provide some accountability and allow them to change their approach if the original plan isn't working.

Throughout your career you may be required to provide coaching to your students, however you may also find yourself providing coaching to your clients and other stakeholders as you become a trusted advisor to an organisation or team.

## Coaching cues

Coaching is dynamic and requires the coach to observe learner cues and change approaches where necessary. The following table gives an outline of these cues and what they could represent.

| Cue                                           | What it could indicate                                                                | Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Repeatedly wanting assistance with tasks      | A lack of confidence Trouble retaining information Lack of mastery of a step or steps | Provide a simple handout with pictures that contain the steps. This will allow the learner to be more autonomous Ask them what they are having trouble with specifically, rather than assisting with the entire task Try to relate to something they can already do well |
| Asking more advanced questions                | They may be ready to move onto a more complex task                                    | Provide more complex tasks Ask them to share their own thoughts encouraging them to reflect and apply what they already know                                                                                                                                             |
| Yawning                                       | You may be talking too much                                                           | Provide hands-on activities where they are doing rather than listening Highlight the importance of the task and how it can be beneficial for them to acquire the skills                                                                                                  |
| Running late for or missing coaching sessions | They may have competing priorities They may not be engaged in the training            | Review the goals with the learner Ask if any changes need to be made Ask what is preventing them from attending the coaching sessions on time                                                                                                                            |

# Learning Transfer

Learning transfer refers to the instance of a student applying skills learnt in a classroom to a workplace context. If a student learns something in a formal training environment but then doesn’t use that those skills and knowledge in the workplace, the value of training for the organisation is eroded significantly. Without learning transfer, it can be argued that the training was a waste of time, money, and effort.

Learning transfer is not entirely up to the student. There are measures the trainer can take, there are environmental aspects and there are measures the manager can take that will all improve the likelihood of learning transfer occurring successfully.

## Learner Readiness

The factors resting with the student consider how prepared the student is to apply their learning. It includes questions such as whether the student is motivated to learn the skills and knowledge in the first place. Where the student is unmotivated, learning transfer is unlikely to occur as the learning is unlikely to be effective. The student’s intent to use their new skills and knowledge should be considered, along with their level of confidence in their new skills and how well their new skills align with their career goals. Where these factors are absent or low, learning transfer is less likely to occur successfully.

## Learning Design

There are three key aspects of learning design that will promote learning transfer. These include having clear, workplace specific goals for the training that the student feels are relevant, having ample opportunity to model and practice the skills within the learning environment in order to boost the student’s confidence in their new skills, and finally providing an opportunity for students to explore how they might apply the learning including the possible opportunities.

## Organisational Alignment

The student’s manager can play a significant role in promoting learning transfer by encouraging and expecting transfer to occur, taking an interest in the student’s progress and providing constructive feedback that supports the student’s self-efficacy and confidence. Without manager engagement, the likelihood of learning transfer has been shown to decrease.

Similarly, peers can also play a role in promoting learning transfer through the support or otherwise afforded the student when they return to the workplace. The level of peer support will likely reflect the learning culture of the organisation and whether learning mistakes are tolerated and encouraged. The learning culture will also promote learning transfer if professional development and learning is seen as an ongoing process of improvement.

The connection between the training content and the job role will also impact learning transfer. This will include aspects such as whether the student is afforded opportunities to practice and apply their new skills immediately – or at all. If a student is being prepared for a new role, they might not have immediate opportunities to practice, and this could result in deterioration in their skills. Alternatively, if there is a disconnect between the training provided and the demands of the job role, the student may never have the opportunity to apply their new skills and knowledge.

## Measures to support learning transfer

Within a work-based learning context, there are several measures that can be implemented to promote learning transfer successfully. These include but are not limited to:

-   Encourage students to set their own goals
-   Practice opportunities
-   Ongoing coaching
-   Self-review mechanisms
-   Reminders of behaviour commitments
-   Feedback on performance
-   Liaison with the supervisor or manager on progress

# Closing the relationship

This section looks at reflecting on and closing the workplace-based learning relationship. You may have reached the stage where your learners are ready to move on.

They may:

-   Have finished their contract, traineeship or apprenticeship
-   Be ready to complete formal assessments
-   Have completed all formal assessments
-   Have achieved the required performance levels
-   Be learning independently
-   Have chosen another delivery method to continue their training
-   Have completed their allocated training time.

A formal ending to the learning relationship:

-   Prevents it from disintegrating due to inactivity. Noting achievements helps stakeholders realise the value of workplace learning; encouraging them to identify and undertake further training opportunities.
-   Gives a sense of closure. After working with individuals in a workplace for an extended period of time, a close relationship often develops. They may become quite dependent on you. During the closure, you can ask the learner how they plan to continue their learning independently.

Where you have been working with an individual, set up a closure meeting with the learner.

Together, review the effectiveness of:

-   Identifying workplace learning opportunities and achieving the objectives. Were there sufficient learning opportunities? Did the learning occur safely without disrupting the work routines?
-   The processes and techniques taught.

Identify whether improvements could be made to current work-based practices.

Take the time to record points on how you could make the training even more effective and relevant next time you deliver it. These points will prompt you next time you deliver this training.

# Learning styles

Learning styles refer to the way we prefer to learn. Learning styles are a combination of how you perceive, organise and process information. You will need to structure your training to appeal to all learning styles.

## Visual, auditory and kinaesthetic

Visual, auditory and kinaesthetic (VAK) learning styles focus on perception. We sense and feel through our five senses: sight, sound, taste, touch and smell.

Most of us have a preference for one or two of these senses. The three senses that are the most significant for learning are sight, sound and touch.

| Learning styles                                              | Characteristics of this learning style                               | Effective delivery strategies for learners with this learning style                                                                                       |

A variation on this model includes reading/writing. Characteristics of a reading or writing dominant learner are they learn through taking notes and through the repetition of words and writing. Provide this learner with an opportunity to take notes and provide handouts and written feedback. Opportunities to write out long-form responses to questions can help these learner’s clarify their thoughts and they can find lists useful.

## Pragmatists, reflectors, activists and theorists

Allan Honey and Peter Mumford’s learning style model, based on Kolb’s learning cycle model (Experiential Learning, 1984) identifies four types of learning preferences: **P**ragmatists, **A**ctivists, **R**eflectors and **T**heorists (PART).

|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pragmatist**  | Like to have a go and try things out to see if they work                                                          | Set practical tasks Ask questions to give learners a chance to ‘try out information’ Use demonstrations and practise Use role plays                  |
| **Activist**    | Need to do something active with the information received                                                         | Engage in brainstorming Set up problem-solving activities Arrange opportunities for group discussion Use role plays Organise competitions            |
| **Reflector**   | Like to consider new information by themselves  Prefer to think about information before putting it into practice | Use worksheets Use journaling activities  Provide self-analysis questionnaires  Set up opportunities for observation Facilitate feedback from others |
| **Theorist**    | Want to understand underlying concepts, theories and relationships                                                | Use models and theories Use group discussion Allow them to apply theories  Provide background information                                            |

## Multiple intelligences

Howard Gardner’s multiple intelligences learning styles are identified below.

| Learning styles                     | Characteristics of this learning style                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Effective delivery strategies for learners with this learning style                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Help the learner set goals and outcomes  Be aware of their strong preferences not to engage in group activities, such as role-plays.                                                                                                           |

## Global and analytical learner model

According to this model, learners can generally be divided into two groups, global learners and analytical learners.

**Global learners** need to see the big picture first. They like to see the whole picture and know the result before beginning.

**Analytical learners** like to learn one piece at a time. They enjoy a clear sequence, which starts at the beginning and moves to the end one step at a time.

Instead of seeing global and analytical learners as two separate groups, imagine that all learners sit somewhere along a continuum which runs between these two positions. Some people move along the continuum depending on the task at hand. Others are more fixed in their preference.

# Advanced learning theories and principles

## What is learning?

Learning:

1.  Is a dynamic process
2.  Develops knowledge that can be applied in different situations
3.  Results in changes in behaviour and perceptions
4.  Works differently for each individual.

Watch the following video called [Adult Learning Styles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eT44OlGdLk) by Kroof Consulting.

## Learning theories

Adults learn differently from children. Adult learners:

-   Often have competing time commitments, such as family and work commitments
-   May have barriers to training, such as a negative experience of school or previous training.

### Malcolm Knowles - Andragogy

Pedagogy relates to the theories of how children learn. Andragogy relates to the theories of how adults learn. Malcolm Knowles’ research[^37] concluded that typically, adults learning needs differ from children in major ways.

[^37]: <https://elearningindustry.com/the-adult-learning-theory-andragogy-of-malcolm-knowles>

**1. Self-concept**

Adults are self-directed. They:

-   Are independent
-   Like to find their own way
-   Can make their own decisions
-   Want to manage their own learning

**2. Experience**

Adults have breadth and depth of experiences to draw on and apply to new learning. They:

-   Have diverse experience and knowledge
-   May have ingrained ideas about things
-   Use problem-solving, critical reflection and reasoning skills

**3. Readiness**

Adults want to learn things that are relevant in a real-to-life context. They:

-   Are goal focused
-   Want just-in-time learning
-   See value in meaningful learning experiences
-   Need a clear ‘why’ and ‘what’ for learning goals

**4. Orientation**

Adults are engaged by learning that is problem-centred and practical. They:

-   Are practical – learning should apply to their lives or job
-   Want to be involved in planning their learning
-   Focus on aspects that are most useful to them

**5. Motivation**

Adults are intrinsically motivated by various value-drivers (not simply more money!):

-   Job satisfaction
-   Self-esteem
-   Quality of life
-   Personal growth and development

These assumptions recognise that there are differences in the ways adults learn from children. Andragogy focuses on the process of learning, rather than the product. It supports discovery-based learning, encouraging learners to construct their own understanding through problem-solving and collaboration with peers.

### David Kolb

Kolb’s theory works on two levels:

1.  A four-stage cycle of learning - Experiential Learning Cycle
2.  Four separate learning styles

#### Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle

In Kolb’s theory, learners, when faced with new experiences, will develop new concepts.

![1. Concrete Experience (Doing - having an experience). 2. Reflective  Observation (Reviewing - reflecting on the experience). 3. Abstract Conceptualisation. (Concluding - learning from the experience). 4. Active Experimentation (Planning - trying out what you have learned).](media/8b88e66bc58a43c6c46e3133ca0d8ec0.png)

© TAFE NSW 2019

1.  **Concrete experience** – experience from doing
2.  **Reflective Observation** – reflect and review
3.  **Abstract Conceptualisation** – sense-making and interpretation
4.  **Active Experimentation** – put into practice.

Effective learning occurs when the learner progresses through *all* four stages.

#### Kolb’s four learning styles

Kolb explains that people fall into different learning styles. These learning styles are influenced by past experiences or individual brain processes.

![Image demonstrating Kolb's Learning Styles](media/027e949329ff838fd960e30cc656e4a0.png)

© TAFE NSW 2019

**Summary of Kolb’s Learning Styles**

-   **Diverging learners** prefer to watch, rather than do. These learners prefer to work in groups, will listen with an open mind and are open to feedback.

    **Assimilating learners** prefer concepts and ideas to people. These learners prefer reading, attending lectures and having time to think things through.

    **Converging learners** are good at problem-solving and practical issues. These learners prefer technical tasks rather than interpersonal issues.

    **Accommodating learners** prefer hands-on activities and use their intuition, rather than logic. These learners prefer to take a practical approach.

In summary, Kolb recommends we:

-   Design activities to cater for all our learners
-   Create activities that take our learners through all four stages of learning.

### Cognitive learning theory

Cognitive learning theory can be defined as the mental process to apply knowledge in new situations to problem solve. This theory can be divided into two specific theories:

#### Social cognitive theory

Suggests that learning occurs from interacting with and observing others in a social environment and takes into account the person’s past experiences, which influence how they reinforce information and the expectancies they have. It is based on the following assumptions:

-   People learn through observation
-   The internal process will decide if you want to learn or not learn the observed behaviour
-   Self-motivation or set goals
-   New learning becomes self-regulating; in other words, you want to learn and learn more.

#### Cognitive behavioural theory

Reflects the importance of combining behavioural and cognitive approaches to understand and help people change their learned behaviour though a reasoning/problem-solving approach, by linking behaviours, feelings and thoughts (or mental process).

Therefore, both cognitive approaches suggest that learning and change behaviour results from:

-   Observation and experience for which we develop a mental perception about the experience or behaviour (process or think it through)
-   To provide insight or problem solving to gain new learning, understanding or behavioural change.

#### Applying cognitive theory to training

We can include:

-   Discovery activities
-   Case studies
-   Roleplays
-   Problem-solving
-   Research
-   Experiential learning
-   Brainstorming
-   Debates.

### Problem-based learning

Problem-based learning uses problems that mirror real-work issues. Students collaborate to understand and solve the problems. These problems help students to transfer their knowledge and skills beyond the training environment to prepare them for the workplace. The problems should be open to give the students the flexibility to approach the problem from different angles.

With problem-based learning, students develop content knowledge as well as critical thinking, creativity and communication skills.

Problem-based learning aligns with the learning theory of andragogy, as adults seek learning that is practical to them, which allows them to implement theories with real-life situations.

## Behavioural learning

Behavioural learning theory[^38] outlines a model of how people learn from their experience, with the belief that much of our behavioural responses are conditioned by events from our background and early experiences.

[^38]: <http://sk.sagepub.com/books/key-concepts-in-healthcare-education/n3.xml>

The key points in this theory:

1.  We learn from our daily experiences.
2.  When encountering new situations, we respond in the ways we think best suit the occasion.
3.  We accumulate knowledge about the likely consequences of our behaviour.
4.  We learn directly from formal learning situations.
5.  This theory focuses on observable behaviours.
6.  Behaviourism discounts any mental activity.
7.  Learning is defined simply as the acquisition of new behaviour. (Pritchard, 2005: 7).
8.  Anybody is capable of learning.

## Principles of adult learning

The following principles are recommended when teaching adults:

1.  Engage adults in a variety of learning strategies to appeal to as many senses and learning styles as possible.
2.  Present learning in bite-sized pieces.
3.  Outline how each component is meaningful to your learners.
4.  Provide timely, respectful and confidential feedback.
5.  Structure (private) practice opportunities in your learning programs.

# Learning objectives

Your learning objectives (or outcomes) are the ‘why’ of training. They should clearly define what the training is designed to achieve.

The learning objectives may be referred to as goals or contained in learning outcomes. They overlap with the purpose of the training but are more defined and specific.

Documented learning objectives are important for all stakeholders to:

-   Ensure a common understanding of the intent of the learning
-   Provide a means to measure the success of the training.

Start with the end in sight and the learning will stay focused on what is important. Make sure you clarify and get agreement from the relevant stakeholders on the objectives before you start the training. This may include managers or supervisors in a work-based setting.

Always explain the objectives and the processes involved to the learner. Describe precisely what your learners should be able to do at the end of the training. In work-based training, you may determine the scope at the same time, deciding what will not be included in the training. For example, the learner will learn how to use machine X according to the manufacturer’s instructions, but servicing the machine is outside the scope of this training.

Learning objectives/outcomes may represent the big picture and apply to an entire qualification or an entire unit of competency, or they may represent a smaller component, such as a one-off 15-minute training session.

Our learning objectives/outcomes need to be S.M.A.R.T:

![SMART. Specific. Measurable. Attainable. Relevant. Time framed.](media/c3439882498e480900aba6a50dd1a00d.png)

© TAFE NSW 2019

To create precise learning objectives/outcomes, ask yourself these questions:

-   **What is the expected performance?** What do I want my students to be able to do at the end of the session?
-   **What are the expected criteria?** How well must my students be able to perform the requirement/task?
-   **In what conditions will this task be carried out?** To address the conditions, consider factors such as the resources or equipment your students will need to access.

Start each learning objective/outcome with a doing word. The doing words in the verb should represent goals that you can see, hear, touch, taste or smell.

The following are examples of doing words in learning outcomes:

List Locate Braid Record

Define Match Wash Create

Cook Operate Identify Transport

Recall Tie Put

## Sample learning objective

By the end of the session, the learner should be able to:

| Performance      | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                 | Conditions                                                                                                                       |

## Activity 57.1: Define a learning outcome

As a class, discuss the following examples and define a learning outcome for the second example.

Look at the two example learning outcomes below. Between them, they have three doing words or verbs. An example learning outcome for the first example is provided in the table that follows.

**Background to learning outcome one**

The learner has started a new position as a courier driver in a rural area. The learner already has a lot of experience driving a manual car. The learner has a month to achieve the learning outcome.

**Background to learning outcome two**

The learner has started a new position in a childcare centre. The learner can already type but has had limited experience with Outlook 2016. The learner has 40 minutes set aside for this training session.

| Learning objective/outcomes | Verb/s | Comment                                                                                                                                                                   |

Using the same two examples, the following table demonstrates how to breakdown the learning objectives/outcomes to meet the performance, criteria and conditions.

**Confirm that your learning outcomes are S.M.A.R.T**

When using the workplace to facilitate learning where real work tasks provide the skills practice or part of the assessment, you need to analyse the work practices and routines to determine their effectiveness in meeting the established learning objectives.

## Activity 57.2: Identifying SMART objectives

Using the example provide for outcome one, identify the SMART objectives for outcome two.

**Background to outcome 1 – Drive a car**

The learner has started a new position as a courier driver in a rural area. The learner already has a lot of experience driving a manual car. The learner has a month to achieve the learning outcome.

**Background to outcome 2 – Create and send an email**

The learner has started a new position in a childcare centre. The learner can already type but has had limited experience with Outlook 2016. The learner has 40 minutes set aside for this training session.

| SMART                                                      | Learning outcome 1:  Drive a car                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Learning outcome 2: Create and send an email |

## Activity 57.3: Creating a learning outcome

Complete the following activity individually. When complete, where possible, work with a partner to review this activity. Read your learning outcomes to your partner. Have your partner assess whether your learning outcome has clear performance, criteria and conditions.

Think of a task that you:

-   Can complete in one minute o**r** less
-   Can be taught to a student in 15 minutes or less.

For example, tie a tie, wash your hands or take a pulse. Create a learning outcome for this task.

# Learner group profiles

There may be a range of information available to you about your leaners before you start planning your session. This information will be useful when planning your session as it will give you some insights into the customisation measures you will be able to implement to better meet the needs of your learners.

By seeking out and gathering this information together, you will be able to develop a learner group profile that will help you understand you learner needs.

Some sources of information include:

-   Enrolment forms
-   LLN screening results
-   Work practice analysis
-   Work skills audits
-   Insights from supervisors or managers
-   Performance appraisal information

    While not all information may be available, the more you are able to access, the more robust your profile will be.

    You may have a lot of questions about your students. Some questions will only be able to be answered once you are in the classroom together and you get to know your students – and they get to know you and are comfortable opening up. Some useful things to know as part of the planning process include:

-   Current job roles
-   Aspirant job roles (if any)
-   Prior experiences relevant to the training
-   Current skills and knowledge
-   LLN skills and any support needs
-   Goals for the training
-   Levels of motivation

## Activity 58.1: Learner group profiles

Consider three things, in addition to those above, you would like to know about your learner group prior to starting to plan your session.

# Session plans

Delivering training is a lot like going on a holiday. You need to know:

-   **When** you are going?
-   **Where** you are going?
-   **Who** you are going with?
-   **What do** you need to take?
-   **How much** you can spend?
-   **How long** you will be away?

Delivering training without a session plan is like driving to a new destination without using a map app. The session will be confusing, convoluted and may involve a waste of valuable time, energy and resources.

Your session plan is your map to delivering a successful training session. Your session plan should contain:

-   **Key points only** – A session plan written like an essay could lead you to read your session plan rather than deliver it, making it less engaging. You would also miss opportunities to make eye contact with and gain valuable cues from your learners. Your session plan acts as a prompt for key points and a monitoring device for timeframes for each section. It is difficult to quickly reference the session plan if it contains every word you intend to say.
-   **Enough information** – If you unexpectedly could not deliver the session, another trainer should be able to step in and follow your session plan. In audit situations, the session plan can also be used to demonstrate training has been planned and covers the unit of competency requirements.

Where do you start? A session plan has four major parts:

-   Background information/administration details about the session
-   Introduction
-   Body of session
-   Conclusion

Actually, you start in the middle! Leave the administration, intro and conclusion until after you have documented the main activity or body of the session. An effective way to achieve this is through a task breakdown.

## Task breakdown

When you become an expert in a task and need to train someone else, it is easy to skip over a step. For example, if you have been driving a car for a number of years, you no longer consciously think about each step in the process, you just perform the steps (to drive the car) automatically. A beginner needs to learn **all** the steps.

To assist you in training your learners in a skill, create a task breakdown. Test your task breakdown by rigidly following the steps yourself or find a volunteer to detect if any steps have been missed. Below is an example of a task breakdown.

**Task** Set a mousetrap

|    | Bring master thumb and forefinger down to the engaged end to replace non-master hand thumb                                                                                        | Ensure fingers are not in a position to be struck if the trap arm slips from under the thumb                                                                                           |

|    | Slowly release the grip of the trap arm with the master thumb and forefinger until the pressure of the trap arm is taken up by the retaining pin and retaining pin lock           | This stage is the most likely stage for the trap arm to be released prematurely.

## Parts in a session plan

Now you have determined the major component of your session we can return to the parts of a session plan and develop your session plan further.

### Part one – Background information

Part one contains background information and administration details about your session. This component sets the scene for your training session. It identifies the:

-   Qualification, units or benchmark the session is based on
-   Pre-requisites or underpinning knowledge requirements
-   Date, time and length of the session
-   Venue, specific location
-   Trainer’s name
-   Other personnel required to assist in organising the training, their roles and responsibilities
-   Learner characteristics including any special needs requirements
-   Delivery methods
-   WHS considerations
-   Details on how learner records are stored and maintained
-   Learning outcomes

**Structure of delivery components of the session plan**

The introduction, body and conclusion all require you to identify the same three important pieces of information:

-   **Time allocated.** Only recording the actual number of minutes to deliver a section, for example, 20 minutes, can be difficult to monitor. Record the time you intend to start and complete each component. For example, 8.15 - 8.35 am. By recording the actual time you have allocated, you make it easier for yourself to track if you are on time.
-   **Content. I**ncludes key points to cover and activities to complete during the session
-   **Resources** required for each component. Be specific in this section; remember your session may need to be understood by someone else. During each portion of your session identify the:
    -   Specific slides you need to refer to if using PowerPoint
    -   Handouts you plan to distribute.

### Part two – Introduction

The introduction represents the first part of the session that involves your learners. An easy way to plan your introduction is with the acronym **G.L.O.S.S.**

In addition to the three components outlined above, your introduction needs to:

**Grab the attention of the group** – This may include showing the product you would like the learners to create, asking a question, using a startling statistic, showing a picture or telling a short story.

**Link the session** – In this component:

-   Describe why your learners need to know this skill.
-   Recap or confirm what your learners already know and how this session relates.
-   Check your learners’ needs: Can they see/hear, are they comfortable with the room temperature? Are they able to participate in the session you have planned?

**Outcomes** – When covering the outcomes address:

-   Performance: What do you want learners to be able to do at the end of the session?
-   Criteria: How well must they be able to perform the requirement/task?
-   Conditions: In what context or situation must the task/skill be performed?

**Sequence or structure** – Involves confirming the roles of the learners and the trainers and the order in which events will take place. This is important, as learners may need to prepare for their specific roles. For example, if they are going on a job site as part of the session, they may need to wear their PPE. This also includes briefly the methods of learning.

**Safety** – Involves:

-   Confirming evacuation procedures.
-   Checking for WHS issues.
-   Confirming the safe practices you would like your learners to follow.

### Part three – Body of the session

Carefully sequence your session. Your session plan needs to follow the learning principle of delivering training in bite-sized pieces.

#### Chunking information

-   Chunking involves breaking information down into sections or parts and then dealing with the parts one piece at a time. Ideally, you should limit yourself to three to five chunks of information at a time.
-   Adults can usually store between five and nine pieces of information in short term memory at one time. We have greater capacity when we are feeling alert and awake, or when the information is simple and well-structured, and we are familiar with the terms and concepts.
-   This means that if we, as trainers, deliver no more than five pieces of information at a time, we should meet everyone’s needs.

#### Sequencing

Sequencing is also very important. The way material is sequenced will affect how easily your learners can comprehend the information. When sequencing your session, take care to:

-   Move from the known to the unknown. This means starting with what your learners already know before introducing new material.
-   Move from global to specific information. This means starting with the big picture and then dropping down into the detail once learners have a basic understanding of what they will be covering.

#### Adding activities

Adding activities to your session plan involves factoring in the following:

-   Learning only takes place when learners are able to process and apply information. Learning activities provide this function.
-   Design and include activities to get your learners directly involved. Provide opportunities for your learners to practise the skills and knowledge you have addressed. Learners need repetition to commit learning to memory.
-   As a rule, aim for at least 50% of the session time to be dedicated to learning activities. Remember to break the theory up by dispersing activities throughout.
-   Learning activities also provide a great way of checking learners’ comprehension and progress.
-   Incorporating formative assessments into the session assists learners to demonstrate their competency progressively.
-   Adding training resources and PowerPoint will bring your sessions to life and help to engage all learning styles.

#### Additional tips

The following table provides some additional tips about planning your resources and activities.

| Activity                                 | Tips to consider                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PowerPoint                               | Use a minimum font size of 28 Use the 6 x 7 rule, no more than 6 words per line, no more than 7 lines per slide Use special effects sparingly  Use PowerPoint as an aid only; your learners will get bored if the whole session is conducted this way. Take regular breaks to apply what they are learning                                                        |
| Electronic presentations such as YouTube | Use targeted portions only Always view the presentation before sharing it with your learners Check you can access the presentation on the computer you are using Can date quickly                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Demonstrations                           | Make sure all learners can see and hear the demonstration Demonstration fast, then slow, with your learners. Then observe as they practise independently                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Games                                    | By having learners participate in pairs or teams, it reduces the risk of embarrassment if a learner does not know an answer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Computer-based activities                | Asking learners to find information themselves can improve their retention as they are actively involved.  Check that all participants can access and use a computer Printed instructions are useful when students are working on computers. It facilitates learners being able to work at their own pace and reduces multiple individual requests for assistance |

### Part four – Conclusion

An easy way to plan your conclusion is with the acronym **O.F.F.**

In addition to having a timing component, information to be shared and resources, your conclusion needs to address the:

**Outcomes of the session** – Revisit the original session outcomes, congratulate the learners on their progress and give them feedback

**Focus** – Get the learners to summarise the required knowledge or steps to complete the task. Make sure the *learners* do the work in this component.

**Future** – Confirm what happens next (session)

## Developing timelines

Remember the following when you develop timelines for your session:

-   Facilitating the learning of the content requires much more time than it would take for you to talk through the session
-   Allow time to set up, changeover between activities and pack up time when determining timeframes for activities
-   As a rule, the larger the group, the longer a process takes, so if you plan practice sessions with a large group the times will need to increase
-   Take into account the levels and abilities of your learners when devising your timelines. It may be necessary to go slowly at the beginning if you have a group of learners with little or no recent education or training
-   It may take your learners a while to get used to learning new skills or information. If the group has considerable content knowledge and recent learning experience, they might move through activities much quicker
-   Always have a contingency plan or activity to cater for sessions that finish quicker than you planned or sessions that require a change of plans at the last minute.

## Documenting your session plan

Get into the habit of using a structured document for your session plans. The session plan:

-   Will help you to remember everything
-   Is useful when a learner is absent to determine what they have missed
-   Can be used to show everything that needs to be covered has been covered in the event of assessment appeals
-   Can be revised with stakeholders or colleagues to identify areas for improvement.

Remember, the session plan is your guide and is not set in concrete. If the session is not working using the plan, then modify it.

I will demonstrate, and then you will set a mousetrap. It is estimated there are X mice in the world, so let’s get started as we could do with a few less. **S** And we will do this by a lecture, demonstration and practice activity **S** just want to remind you of the WHS issues…. | Identify the tools and materials to be used                               |

# Specialist support

While all learners have a need for support in the learning process, some of your participants may have characteristics that require you to plan for and provide additional support to help their participation.

Support may take the form of equipment such as audio induction loops to assist people using hearing aids, wheelchair accessible and height adjustable work-stations and FM microphone systems in classrooms. Alternatively, it could take the form of resources such as Google translate, note-takers, or access to digital platforms with additional activities. Finally it may take the form of services

Learners can have many different support needs. Equity or additional support needs may include:

-   English language, literacy and numeracy support
-   Disability support
-   Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander student services
-   Multicultural support services
-   Interpreting services
-   Counselling services
-   Financial assistance
-   Community support.

## Examples of specialist support

The following are some situations where specialist support may be required and the type of support that may be offered.

### Physical conditions

There can be physical conditions that have no bearing on the learner/candidates ability to effectively do the task.

| Condition | Support options                                          |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Mobility  | Provide desk that a wheelchair will fit under            |
| Hearing   | Provide a signer, use special devices that promote audio |
| Sight     | Use programs that read aloud to the candidate            |

### Language, literacy and numeracy issues

| Situation                    | Support options                                                                    |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dyslexia                     | Tutorial support from an LLN specialist In-class assistance from an LLN specialist |

# Organising logistics

**Murphy’s Law – Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.**

You are responsible for planning your session so it will run smoothly and professionally. Once your students arrive, you need to focus on meeting their needs. Having the logistics professionally organised and confirmed will allow you to do this.

The logistics of training refers to the resources, equipment, processes and communication that need to be planned, organised and confirmed before your training session.

When organising training, the logistics you need to consider may include:

1.  Location and venue
2.  The stakeholders you need to rely on, such as security personnel to open and close the venue
3.  Timing
4.  Identifying and meeting student’s needs
5.  Training resources and equipment.

The table below contains examples of the logistics you could be responsible for organising and what you need to confirm for each.

# Presentation skills

An effective trainer is an excellent communicator and therefore thinks about improving his or her presentation skills. One of the most important aspects of communicating is shaping both content and style to fit your audience. In the classroom, if you cannot communicate in a way that is both comprehensible and interesting to your students, their learning will be greatly reduced. A lot of good teaching is a performance – one that holds the attention of your students.

To strengthen your presentation skills, focus on improving your skills in these three areas:

## Verbal and non-verbal communication

-   **Find out all you can about the room in which you will be presenting.** Visit the room ahead of time to familiarize yourself with its size and layout, as well as the type of whiteboards, markers (always carry at least one of your own), erasers, and and projection technology available. In addition, obtain any necessary training on the multimedia and check that your laptop and files are compatible with the equipment in the room.
-   **Use the classroom as a stage.** Move around to engage and interact with your audience. Do not stand in one spot the entire time. Move with purpose; do not walk aimlessly.
-   **Prepare.** Preparation is essential. All excellent trainers are well prepared for each class. Practice in the room if you can, especially if you are new to teaching. In addition, prepare yourself emotionally and psychologically by taking the time to organize your thoughts and to look forward to teaching before every class.
-   **Speak loudly and clearly.** Project your voice and face your audience when you are speaking. Speak slightly louder than you do in a normal conversation.
-   **Modulate the tone, pitch, and speed of your speech.** Do not speak in a monotone. Vary the pitch and speed of your voice for emphasis and effect. Use appropriate pauses. Rather than using filler words such as “uh,” for example, simply pause before moving on to the next idea or point.
-   **Use gestures and facial expressions to help you explain, emphasize, and communicate the material.** However, be careful not to develop distracting habits such as pacing or repeatedly adjusting your glasses or hair. To find out if you are unconsciously doing anything that may be distracting to your audience, have a colleague observe one of your classes or have your class videotaped.
-   **Develop a teaching persona.** Decide how you want to be perceived and what mannerisms you want to have. For example, do you want to be quiet, humorous, formal, or informal? Whatever persona is right for you, aim to convey confidence and ease. Move with certainty and assuredness, and be careful not to seem pompous or intimidating.
-   **Show passion and enthusiasm for the topic.** If you are not interested in the subject, you cannot expect your students to be interested, either. Point out the fascinating aspects of what they are learning. Standing up can bring a whole new level of energy to your teaching and taking your hands out of your pockets
-   **Do not read your notes or slides.** Doing so will lower your energy level and lead your audience to feel less engaged. Make your notes in point form so you can’t be tempted.
-   **Interact with and pay attention to your audience.** Make eye contact with the students, not with the wall or whiteboard. Build a rapport with the class. Use student names – develop strategies to ensure you remember their names when they introduce themselves. Make sure the class is with you (following and understanding what you are discussing). If they appear to be lost, take additional time to explain points and to ask and answer questions.
-   **Do not take yourself too seriously.** Be able to laugh at yourself and your mistakes. Feel free to bring humour into the classroom, but direct it at yourself, rather than at your students’ questions and ideas. Be confident enough to admit you don’t know something and find it out with the student.
-   **Keep track of the time.** Start on time and finish on time. The students often do not recall or listen to information presented after the class period is technically finished. If you have trouble with breaks, make the time specific, eg: “back from break at 1:07” and stick to it

## Effective use of the whiteboard and visual-aids

### **Using the whiteboard**

-   Write legibly and big enough that your writing can seen in the back of the room.
-   Think about the organization of the material on the board.
-   Fill one board at a time, starting at the top of each board and writing down.
-   Do not scrunch in words at the very bottom of the board or in the margins. The students in the back will not see the words at the bottom, and no one will see the words in the margins.
-   Underline or mark major assumptions, conclusions, etc.
-   Use colour to emphasize points. Before the course starts, determine which colours are most visible in the back of the room. Green is usually a disaster
-   Erase a board only when you have run out of room.
-   If you find a mistake on a previous board, do not erase it. Cross it out, then write the correction in, which is what the students must do.
-   Allow students an opportunity to take a photo of your whiteboard

### **Using visual aids, such as powerpoint slides**

-   Do not use visual aids unless they serve a clear and important purpose. Visuals should aid quick comprehension and support the main points.
-   Book and check out the presentation equipment in advance.
-   Talk to your audience and not to the screen.
-   Use the visuals to enhance your presentation, not as a substitute for a verbal presentation.
-   Use a pointer, if necessary.
-   Coordinate the audio and the visual and practice the technical transitions to and from and videos or other aids
-   Design your visuals with clarity and simplicity in mind.
-   Simple is best

## Effective design and meaningful organization of content

### **Visual design suggestions**

-   Use single words or phrases.
-   Organize the content visually.
-   Choose a font that is easy to see. Choose a font that is simple, plain, and easy to read such as Times New Roman, Ariel, or Helvetica. Select a font size that is large enough to be seen at the back of the room. The minimal acceptable size is typically 24-point. Use both upper- and lower-case letters; all upper-case letters are difficult to read.
-   Keep the design simple. Too many words, graphics, or different colours are distracting and cause students to miss the important points.
-   Use short quotes, not long extracts, from documents.
-   Assign a title for each visual. Doing so will help your audience organize and retain the information on each visual.
-   Use summary lists.
-   Limit the number of ideas on each visual. For example, limit the number of bullets on a page to approximately 4 to 6. Each bullet should be short, approximately one line. Do not crowd the visual with text; it will be too difficult to read.
-   Use colour for emphasis and organization. Colour is useful, but needs to be used judiciously. The colour should be used for emphasis or for distinguishing among data. Think about the colour wheel: adjacent colours blend together and colours directly opposite each other are contrasting and provide better readability. Reds and oranges stand out, but are hard to continually focus on; therefore, use these colours only for emphasis. Greens, blues, and browns are easier to continually focus on, but do not grab a person’s attention.
-   Design diagrams and tables that are simple and clear, with readily recognized symbols. Your audience must be able to read all data in your diagrams and tables. Often, this means that you will have to simplify a more complex or detailed table or diagram that has been prepared for a printed format.
-   Use horizontal (landscape) layout, not vertical (portrait). Screens, video monitors, and computer monitors are shaped for a horizontal, not a vertical, format. In addition, a horizontal format is easier to project in rooms with low ceilings.

### **Content organization suggestions**

-   **Plan the content.** Think about the type of students in the class, the goals for the course and the current session, the type of material to be presented in the current session, and the type of media, if any, that you are going to use.
-   **Provide a structure.** Each class session or presentation should have a beginning, a middle, and an end.
-   **List objectives or provide an outline at the beginning of each class session.** Providing an outline helps students identify the most important points and follow the lecture or discussion more effectively.
-   **Organize course content with a theme or storyline.** How do you want to arrange the material? How does each part of the material relate to what comes next. Use your models and learning principles to inform your decisions. Consider your LLN support strategies to make your teaching polished and tight.
-   **Remember that a typical student’s attention span is 15-20 minutes.** Every 15-20 minutes, either change your teaching method or change activities. Use different teaching methods in one session to keep the students’ attention and to reach students who have different learning preferences.
-   **Allow for pauses and “wait-time.”** Wait-time is the pause after the instructor either asks a question or asks for questions. Students need time to think of a response to a question, or to think of a question to ask. Do not be afraid of silence. Most instructors wait 1-3 seconds for a response. However, increasing the wait-time to 5-10 seconds dramatically increases the number and quality of responses. 5-10 seconds feels like 5 years in a classroom and 10 years if you are delivering online.

There is much that can be said and written about presentation skills – enough to fill entire books, and enough books to fill entire bookshelves. Keep reading, keep pushing to improve and keep asking questions.

## If you forget everything else –

-   Be yourself and relax – you are much more engaging when you are natural
-   Respect your students as partners on a learning journey with you – you will learn just as much as they will – enjoy the time you get to spend with them
-   You know your stuff. You are more than enough just as you are – your authentic self is your best self
-   

# Facilitating discussions

Discussion can be a critical tool in the classroom but can also be risky for the ill-prepared trainer.

Discussion, facilitated well, represents significant benefits for students and the trainer:

-   It builds community through the sharing of perspectives, understandings, experience and story
-   It can strengthen relationships through constructive disagreement
-   It can help develop communication skills, particularly for those students who may be reluctant, nervous or anxious to speak in front of a group
-   It can build confidence
-   It can be used as a piece of formative assessment by the trainer, providing insight has to how well the student understands the content based on their contributions.

    Discussions can be held for a variety of different purposes and will look different accordingly. Each type of discussion will also place different demands on the students in terms of what and how they contribute but will also place different demands on the trainer in terms of how they facilitate the discussion. Common types of discussions include:

-   Solve a problem
-   Brainstorm ideas
-   Reach a consensus
-   Share experience
-   Explore concepts and their application
-   Argument or debate

    It is important to be clear on the type of discussion you want to hold, what value you expect the students to get from it and what you starting question or proposition is. The clearer these three elements, the more likely you will be able to generate robust discussion.

    One of the biggest risks with discussion is having no or limited contributions from students. Typically, there are three key factors that cause this:

1.  The opening question was vague, and your students are unsure what you are really asking and how to respond to it. The clearer your opening question, the better. Effective questions will be open questions, challenging questions or Socratic questions (we will look at Socratic questions in more detail). Ineffective questions are questions that are closed, questions where you answer yourself rather than allowing the students to answer, questions only addressed to the strong students, leading questions, questions that have multiple parts to them – students will only answer one part and will ignore the other, irrelevant questions, trick questions that make students who respond look silly, and the question that wasn’t asked at all
2.  They are still thinking about their response. Provide up to 10 seconds of thinking time before expecting a response
3.  Students are disengaged. Cold calling on students to contribute (after you have given them plenty of thinking time) can get things started. If students think they may be called on unexpectedly, they are more likely to engage and will start contributing voluntarily.

    You will play an important role in supporting students to engage effectively and enthusiastically with discussion. Your role and behaviours will vary from group to group, depending on their needs, level of engagement, and the dynamics of the group. Some of the important skills you will need to bring to the discussion when facilitating include:

-   Be clear on your desired outcome for the discussion but be prepared to achieve something else. A robust discussion may veer off into unanticipated, but valuable territory. You need to decide on the spot whether the new direction is worth following
-   Ask targeted questions that follow up, probe and ask the student to contribute more
-   Wait… and then wait some more, let the thinking happen. It can feel like a very long time
-   Cold call techniques such as calling on students unexpectedly for a response. It is also ok to call on the same student to respond to consecutive questions – let’s them know they can’t disengage just because they’ve answered a question
-   You will need every active listening skill you have. You need to listen to what is being said, what isn’t being said and what is being meant all at once.
-   Paraphrase the student’s response, connect it to the material being discussed, extend the response a little bit further and take the opportunity to model the language and jargon of your industry
-   Share the spotlight amongst the students to ensure equitable contribution. If you need to keep track of who has and hasn’t responded, then do so
-   Challenge students to extend their responses a bit further, and a bit further, and to be a bit clearer

    When preparing for a discussion, consider the following questions:

-   What prior knowledge or experience do students bring to the topic?
-   Will it be all of class, or small group?
-   How long will it go for?
-   How much will you contribute? Generally, the more students contribute the better
-   What will be the spark (case study, problem, controversy, ideas, questions)?
-   How will you ensure equitable participation?
-   **What is the point** or outcome of the discussion?

## Small group discussions

Small group discussions can be an equally valuable learning experience, particularly when you want to increase the amount each student needs to participate and contribute.

There is a myriad of techniques you can use to put students into groups. For some classes, with a strong class dynamic, it won’t really matter who is with who. For other classes there may be specific students you want to split up and for the really difficult classes you may want to be very deliberate about who goes in what group. Consider grouping students by years of experience, first letter of their surname, numbering off 1-4 around the room to make four groups, let students form their own groups or allocate the groups yourself.

It can be useful to assign roles within a group such as a scribe, a spokesperson, a timekeeper and a facilitator in online groups. You may ask specific people to play a specific role or you may ask the groups to self-nominate. Being explicit on the roles you will need the students to play will help them manage their small group dynamic.

Group discussions will need very clear instructions on what you want them to do and discussion and the expectations you have of them. This clarity is even more important in online classes as once students are in their groups, it can be difficult and time consuming to clarify and points in the instructions.

Monitor student progress, particularly when you are unsure how long an activity or a discussion will take, allowing for some groups to explore concepts in more detail than others. Keep an eye out for any heated discussions or behaviours that might need to be addressed before they cause larger problems. Resist intervening at the first sign of uncertainty, often groups can work together to figure their way through uncertainty and problems. These can be good opportunities to develop team work and communication skills.

## Socratic questioning

Socrates was an ancient Greek philosopher and teacher known for his question-based approach to teaching to prompt a thoughtful, and disciplined dialogue amongst his students. Socrates believed that through deep consideration of questions, students would be able to examine ideas logically and rationally and determine the validity and value of those ideas.

There are six types of socratic questions:

**1. Questions for clarification:**

-   Why do you say that?
-   How does this relate to our discussion?
-   "Are you going to include diffusion in your mole balance equations?"

**2. Questions that probe assumptions:**

-   What could we assume instead?
-   How can you verify or disapprove that assumption?
-   "Why are neglecting radial diffusion and including only axial diffusion?"

**3. Questions that probe reasons and evidence:**

-   What would be an example?
-   What is....analogous to?
-   What do you think causes to happen...? Why:?
-   "Do you think that diffusion is responsible for the lower conversion?"

**4. Questions about Viewpoints and Perspectives:**

-   What would be an alternative?
-   What is another way to look at it?
-   Would you explain why it is necessary or beneficial, and who benefits?
-   Why is the best?
-   What are the strengths and weaknesses of...?
-   How are...and ...similar?
-   What is a counterargument for...?
-   "With all the bends in the pipe, from an industrial/practical standpoint, do you think diffusion will affect the conversion?"

**5. Questions that probe implications and consequences:**

-   What generalizations can you make?
-   What are the consequences of that assumption?
-   What are you implying?
-   How does...affect...?
-   How does...tie in with what we learned before?
-   "How would our results be affected if neglected diffusion?"

**6. Questions about the question:**

-   What was the point of this question?
-   Why do you think I asked this question?
-   What does...mean?
-   How does...apply to everyday life?
-   "Why do you think diffusion is important?"

## Activity 63.1: Socratic questions

Identify one content area that you expect to be teaching (you may choose your topics for your upcoming assessments).

Develop some (at least one each) socratic questions against each question type relevant to your chosen content area:

| Question Type                                      | Proposed Questions |

| Questions about the question                       |                    |

# Demonstration Skills

Skills based classes will require you to demonstrate skills and then support students through the mastering of these skills. Some students will master the skills reasonably quickly, just needing some feedback and then they are on their way. Others might need more intense coaching.

For students requiring skill coaching, there is a five step process that can help you structure your approach:

**Stage one - Diagnosis**

-   How did you know that this learner needed coaching?

**Stage two- Planning**

-   What activities, resources and strategies could you use to coach this person?

**Stage three – Preparation**

-   What might you need to get ready or organise in order to coach this learner?

**Stage four - Deliver**

-   Deliver the additional training

**Stage five - Evaluate**

-   How would you know whether the coaching has been successful?

## Activity 64.1: Coaching example

The table below describes the five stages of coaching in the workplace:

-   An example has been provided for you on the task of teaching somebody how to drive a forklift.
-   In the third column, work with a partner to create your own coaching example.

| Coaching stage                                                                                             | Forklift example                                                                                                                                                    | Your example |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **Stage one - Diagnosis**  How did you know that this learner needed coaching?                             | New recruit No forklift licence Accidents/near misses using the forklift Requested training Directed by a supervisor because of legislation Training needs analysis |              |
| **Stage two- Planning** What activities, resources and strategies could you use to coach this person?      | Video Training manual Demonstration Feedback Practice                                                                                                               |              |
| **Stage three – Preparation** What might you need to get ready or organise in order to coach this learner? | PPE Pre-operational check of forklift Create a safe training environment (signs, barriers) Notify other stakeholders Create a task breakdown                        |              |
| **Stage four - Deliver** Deliver the training                                                              | Explain the task Demonstrate the task Supervise practice Give feedback                                                                                              |              |
| **Stage five - Evaluate** How would you know whether the coaching has been successful?                     | Accredited assessment, such as a forklift licence Feedback from trainer/trainee Reduction in accidents/near misses Observation, demonstration By asking questions   |              |

## Stage four steps

The following diagram represents the steps in stage four of coaching in the workplace.

It’s important to note that the steps involved in delivering the training do not always go in a clockwise direction. You may need to add additional explanations, practice opportunities or feedback, as required.

## Skills demonstration

Vocational education and training has a focus on attaining skills. Your ability to effectively demonstrate skills and organise practice opportunities will help you your learners develop their knowledge and skills.

The rhyme above will help you to remember a good structure for demonstrating a work skill. Structuring and pacing in this way will enhance the learning.

1.  **Do it once** –Demonstrate at normal speed. This demonstrates to your learner what they are aiming for.
2.  **Do it slow** –Chunk down the learning. This means you break the task into steps that can be followed. A task breakdown can help you determine how many steps you need. Explain each step as you perform the task. To improve retention, give the learner a written procedure of the task to follow as you are demonstrating. They can refer to this procedure when they are working independently.
3.  **Do it together** – Encourage the learner to perform the task under your guidance. Assist where necessary to ensure they use the correct techniques. Explain the concepts, rather than just teaching by rote.
4.  **Off you go** – Give the learner plenty of opportunities to practise and receive feedback on their progress. Gradually reduce your involvement in the task until the learner can perform it independently. Vary the tasks to include more complex applications. If you have taught the concepts, rather than by rote, the learner will be able to transfer the knowledge and skills to different applications. Remind the learner you are available if they need further coaching through the task.

# Interpersonal skills

Interpersonal skills are the foundations of face-to-face training.

Expressing yourself professionally and effectively through non-verbal communication engages your learners. Confidence and energy are very appealing characteristics. Your energy, enthusiasm and warmth for the subject matter can be contagious!

The table below includes tips on how to successfully engage your learners through each of the different categories of body language

| Category of body language | Tips for using this category effectively                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Personal presentation     | You only get one opportunity to make a first impression. Model the industry standards for footwear, clothing and PPE to match the task/topic in which you are training your learners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Eye contact               | Make regular eye contact with your learners. This will help them to engage in what you are saying and will give you feedback on what they are thinking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Facial expressions        | Use your facial expressions to encourage your learners. Smile and make eye contact with each learner as they arrive. Be conscious of frowning and the message it can send out to your learners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Gestures                  | Sometimes when we are nervous, we can unconsciously engage in repetitive and unnecessary gestures, for example, clicking a pen. Ask a friend for honest feedback to determine if you have any regular distracting gestures. Implement positive strategies to reduce any annoying gestures, for example, leave the pen on the table.                                                                                                      |
| Posture                   | An upright open stance will give your learners confidence in your ability. Take care not to be overly dominating though, as VET is more about facilitating a learning process. You may prefer to sit if you are working one on one or with just a few learners. If you need to demonstrate a task, such as lifting a box, always model the task safely and professionally. Leaners will remember what you did, more than what you said.  |
| Touch                     | You may have a topic that involves touching your learners, such as taking a pulse or delivering a firm handshake. Always ask permission before touching a learner. Take care to follow any culturally appropriate guidelines.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Space                     | Take the time to set up a spacious, clutter-free training environment. Rearrange the training environment so you and your learners can move freely and safely. Reposition any awkwardly placed furniture or equipment.  Getting physically close to your learners can make your training more personal, but you will need to be aware of and follow any protocols relevant to the communities you are addressing.                        |
| Volume                    | Varying your volume is an effective training tool. It can be used to emphasise key points. Speaking softly can sometimes be more effective at gaining attention than speaking loudly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Speed                     | Getting the speed right can be tricky. If you talk too slowly, learner’s minds will wander. Talking too fast and racing through your session can make you and your learners feel anxious. If you feel yourself racing and stumbling over your words, pause, take a breath, and start your sentence again.                                                                                                                                |
| Tone                      | Engage your learners with intonation. Use tone to emphasise certain points. Learners will tune out if all they hear is a monotone voice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## GAVE model

In summary, use the **GAVE** model to keep your learners engaged.

## Know your learners

Getting to know your learners helps to build trust and openness. This can include:

-   Finding out what their hobbies or interests are
-   Knowing when their birthday is and acknowledging it with a simple happy birthday if it falls during the training
-   Being aware of significant others in the learners’ lives – this could be family members or pets.

You need to maintain your professionalism, but particularly when you are conducting skills training with a very small group or one on one. Knowing a little more about the learners can help build a positive relationship. Your learners need to be safe and comfortable to learn.

# Diversity

Your learner group is likely to be a mini representation of the greater community. Each individual is unique with different characteristics and experience.

As a trainer, you have the privilege of showcasing the benefits of diversity. Sharing different perspectives can broaden the learning experience of your learner group. Here are some examples of how you can use the diversity of the group as another resource to support the learning:

-   **Experience** – Ask learners who have experience and strengths in an area to share their knowledge. They may be willing to assist learners who are having difficulties, helping the class move along at the same pace and giving them valuable mentoring experience. They may have a different way of explaining that will assist the learner.
-   **Culture** – During discussions about the learning topics, ask different cultures to share their perspective. Include in the ground rules the need to accept different viewpoints before you start this.
-   **Personality** – Use the strengths of your group. Groups tend to have a natural:
    -   Organiser, who can assist with dispersing handouts or being a scribe on the whiteboard
    -   Leader, who can break the ice by going first with an activity. They can help keep the group on task and progressing
    -   Joker, who may lighten the atmosphere after heavy topics
-   **Age** – The age or your learners can provide vastly different perspectives and skills:
    -   Use older learners to share their historical knowledge and wisdom
    -   Use younger learners to assist with technology or suggest a fresh new approach. They may be more open to experimentation
-   **Gender** – Share the different perspectives to broaden understanding
-   **Interests** – The different interests of learners’ means they may have varying skills that are relevant to the training. Sometimes it is an easier way to understand a topic rather than jumping straight into a work-based application.

# Feedback

**The first step to sharing effective feedback is to engage in effective listening.**

You need to be able to listen very carefully to what the learner is saying. Your learners will want to know that their efforts, comments and input are valued by you.

## Activity 67.1: Effective listening

Discuss the following as a group.

1.  How can you show a learner that you are listening?

|   |
|---|

1.  If a learner says something you do not understand, what should you do?

|   |
|---|

## Constructive feedback

Giving and receiving positive and negative feedback is a large part of being a trainer and assessor, and it can be a difficult skill to master. When giving constructive feedback, you risk leaving the learner feeling defensive and frustrated.

Feedback gives information to learners about:

-   What they are doing well
-   Their progress
-   Areas they can work on.

Providing feedback and encouragement, whether verbal or non-verbal, can have a significant effect on how well participants learn and how well they will perform.

A few suggestions to keep in mind when giving feedback:

-   Highlight what the learners did well
-   Be encouraging
-   Make suggestions for improvement
-   Focus on the work/evidence, not the learner
-   Be specific rather than general
-   Give recommendations for improvement privately
-   Some cultures feel uncomfortable receiving praise in public.

Some useful phrases are:

-   “I really like the way you ……”
-   “I noticed that you ……”
-   “You certainly know the….”
-   “Have you considered….”
-   Avoid using “but” – it negates what you have already said.

In VET, feedback should be a two-way process, where the learner’s performance is discussed with the learner. A useful structure for giving feedback is:

1.  Ask the learner how they feel they went. This leads them to identify their own strengths and weaknesses.
2.  Ask them what they would do differently next time. This allows them to be self-directed, and they will have ownership of the action.
3.  Commend – Praise what they have done well.
4.  Recommend – Make a couple of suggestions for improvement. Normally with verbal feedback, only give them a couple of things to work on.
5.  Commend – Leave on a positive note, demonstrating your confidence in their abilities.

### Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is a skill you can use to clarify what the learners are saying. Do this so you are certain you understand the learner and can respond appropriately with an answer or further information. Paraphrasing is where you repeat back to the learner in your own words what they have said.

The format of paraphrasing could be something like:

“I just want to make sure I understand. What you are saying is you are having difficulty with A because of B. Is that correct?”

### Encouraging learners

While giving feedback is helpful and necessary for your learners to know how they are progressing, it is just as important that participants learn how to assess their own performance and progress.

Some techniques that learners can use for self-assessment include:

-   Asking other participants for feedback
-   Asking colleagues about specific aspects of their performance
-   Discussing their workplace progress with a supervisor
-   Keeping notes about the things that they did well and ways they could improve.

### Sharing assessment feedback

Feedback, as a result of an assessment event, should still follow the guidelines outlined above. Assessment event feedback needs to be planned and formal.

It is essential that feedback given as part of an assessment is:

-   Given confidentially
-   Documented
-   Signed off by both the candidate and the assessor
-   Supported by opportunities for another assessment attempt, if the candidate has been assessed as “Not Yet Satisfactory” in their first attempt.

## Activity 67.2: Giving feedback

Read the following scenarios and phrase your feedback to your fellow students in the space provided.

1.  A fellow student has delivered a training session where she was very enthusiastic about the content she was delivering. She was bubbling over with excitement but spoke too quickly. You had to concentrate very hard to understand what she was saying and did not get enough time to reflect on what she had said.

|   |
|---|

1.  A fellow student is very friendly and approachable. Everyone feels like he has put a lot of time into developing his delivery. However, he did not use a session plan, so the outcomes for the delivery were not clear. He was enthusiastic and chatting throughout the delivery, but this led to him going off topic.

# Facilitating and managing learner behaviours

One of our responsibilities as a trainer of VET learners is to create a safe training environment for your learners and yourself, both physically and psychologically. At times, this involves facilitating and managing learner behaviours.

## Prevention

Prevention is better than cure. The key to success when facilitating and managing learner behaviours is to be clear from your very first session about the preferred behaviours in the training environment. The goal for our VET learners is that they will participate effectively in the workforce. It is our responsibility to set and model behaviours that are appropriate in a workplace environment.

The first time you gather your learners together, whether it is in a face-to-face meeting environment, or a virtual meeting environment, invest the time to work together to create and advertise a set of group norms. This does not mean the trainer sets the rules. This needs to be an activity that all your learners assist with.

## Group norms

Tips for creating group norms include the following.

1.  Ask your learners the two questions below about their experiences with past training opportunities. Record their answers.

    **What did you enjoy about this training?**

    Answers may include the training was interactive and moved along at an appropriate pace or learners knew exactly what was expected of them.

    **What was frustrating about this training?**

    Answers may include certain students monopolised class time; others came in late or continually answered their phone in class.

2.  Share with your learners the term group norms. Group norms are just another way of saying “The way we do things around here”. Pinup butcher’s paper with this heading. Have learners revisit the factors that frustrated them about previous training. Ask them to suggest a strategy that could have been implemented to prevent this frustrating factor, for example, phones to remain on silent.
3.  Record strategies to encourage all the enjoyable factors and limit all the frustrating factors that the learners previously identified.
4.  Invite learners to critique the group norms you have created as a class. Invite your learners to modify or add to this list. If common points have been missed, such as phones continually being answered in class, suggest this example yourself.
5.  Share with your class that this is a living document. This means the document can be altered by the group at any time during training.
6.  Revisit the norms at the end of your first session to gauge how successfully they have been implemented.
7.  Revisit the norms at the beginning of the second session to remind learners of what the class has agreed upon. Take the time to introduce these norms to any students who missed the first session.
8.  Display these norms in every session. Revisit and amend as required.

## Inappropriate learner behaviours

There will be times when you must manage inappropriate learner behaviours during a training session. If you have a learner who looks like this:

The first question you need to ask yourself is:

**“What have I done which may have contributed to the learner feeling this way?”**

Be proactive; ask your learner this question. If you have contributed to this behaviour, for example, you may have talked too fast or introduced too many tasks at once, take steps to remedy this situation. Your actions may have caused more than one learner to feel this way.

If you have a learner, who begins to take their frustration out in inappropriate ways that impact upon other learners, take steps to quickly and safely deal with this inappropriate behaviour. These steps may include:

-   Asking the learner if they would like some help
-   Inviting the learner to talk with you in a quieter environment (whilst taking care to protect your safety and the safety of other learners)
-   Asking the learner to step away from other learners and equipment
-   Asking the learner to leave the training environment
-   Asking another learner to leave the session and notify your training manager or security.

It may be daunting at first, but there are some common behaviours that can occur. Considering them before you start training and the techniques you can use to handle the situation will help you to remain calm and professional. Following are some of the behaviours that may occur.

-   **The mouth** - They will talk constantly, loudly and over the top of others. Politely thank them for their involvement but point out that you would like to hear the opinion of “X” (another learner in the room). You can also give the mouth a whiteboard marker and ask them to write the major points on the board. It is hard to continue to dominate the conversation while you are writing. Make sure though that they record the thoughts of the group and not just their own ideas. If the mouth is allowed to continue to dominate the class, quieter learners will stop participating.
-   **The pessimist** - It does not matter what you do; this person will be negative. Unfortunately, this can be catchy, so before you lose everyone’s commitment, you need to tactfully show that being negative is not going to help the situation. Try asking the pessimist what they would like to happen. Most of the time, they will not have a workable solution, but if they do see if you can modify your training to suit. If they are interrupting the flow of the session try showing some empathy, but then point out that the learning is still required and if they can focus on it you will get through it as quickly as possible. Allowing complaining to flow uninterrupted can mean the learning takes longer to accomplish. Tell them you will be happy to discuss their problems with the program during a break.
-   **The Know-It-All** – This learner believes they know more about the subject than you and at every opportunity they will try to prove it. They may even try to prove you wrong. Offer them recognition of prior learning (RPL), a challenge test or an assessment only pathway. You do not want this person challenging you in class. Often they do not know as much as they claim, and when you offer them the assessment without the training, they may back down. You could also acknowledge their expertise and then suggest they could greatly assist you by mentoring another person in the class. They may then reveal that they are a little rusty on the topic and politely decline the invitation. If they do decide to mentor someone, you will need to ensure they are telling the other learners accurate and up-to-date information. As tempting as it may be, do not humiliate them in front of the class. Nobody wins if you do this. Often a know-it-all is actually a person lacking confidence who needs reassurance.
-   **The Mouse** - This is the timid learner who is afraid to express their opinion. They may become a doormat and do whatever the group wish them to do. Find out about the experience of this person. Pose a question you know they can answer from their experience and phrase the question “X, I know you have worked in this field can you please tell us about it”. Make sure you praise them for the slightest amount of participation. When they do say something, offer them positive re-enforcement and refer back to it, “Just like “X” said…..” You may try breaking into pairs for some activities. This will help build the learners confidence as they cannot hide in the crowd and will need to have an input but have the security of another person.

**Other inappropirate behaviours could be**

-   violent or inappropriate language
-   verbal or physical abuse or bullying
-   insensitive verbal or physical behaviour towards other learners or the trainer/facilitator, including cultural, racial, disability or gender-based insensitivities
-   dominant or overbearing behaviour
-   disruptive behaviour
-   non-compliance with safety instructions.

Keep in mind some behaviours may be cultural, and you may have to adjust your responses to cater for cultural diversity.

Dealing effectively with difficult learners will benefit both the learners and you. You do not want one person to sabotage your training.

Here are some simple tactics you can use that enable you to maintain control without it being too obvious:

-   Breaking into groups is good for both drawing out quieter learners and quietening down louder ones
-   Structured discussion by systematically giving each learner the opportunity to say something
-   Mixing up groups, sometimes learners will sit next to a colleague and then distract each other. You can fix this by counting 1 to 4 around the room while pointing to each learner and then telling them to form groups with other learners of the same number. This is also a subtle way of breaking up a group clique.
-   Take uncooperative people to the side and ask how you can make the learning more meaningful to them. Sometimes you may have to point out that they are disrupting others in the group and that you cannot allow this to continue to happen.

## Learning Difficulties

Be aware that some behaviours may indicate learning difficulties. A learner may act the **class clown** or be **pessimistic** to mask that they are not coping with the learning.

Learning difficulties could be

-   Shy learners
-   dysgraphia where learners try and avoid handwriting, particularly in front of their peers
-   dyslexia where learners will have issues with writing and seeing the written word
-   slow to complete tasks or assessments’
-   disruptive
-   acting like the “class clown”
-   being somewhat pessimistic and generally disruptive.
-   Unable to work independently – constantly asking questions to both the teacher and other learners

If you suspect learning difficulties:

-   Take them aside individually
-   Be open and supportive
-   Ask questions to encourage them to disclose the problems.

## Activity 68.1: Inappropriate behaviours

Below is an example of how to handle inappropriate behaviour displayed during training. Nominate another inappropriate behaviour you may encounter from a learner in your industry and add the details about what you would do about this inappropriate behaviour. Share your strategies with your class. In the table list the:

-   Inappropriate behaviour
-   The factors that could have contributed to/caused this behaviour
-   Strategies to try and prevent this behaviour
-   Methods to deal with this behaviour if it happened in your class.

An example has been completed for you.

# Reflective practice

One of the most important strategies for improving your performance and capability as a trainer is to engage in reflective practice. This requires habitual consideration of your recent sessions in a classroom and considering what changes you may have made to make them better.

Reflective practice provides a means for trainers to improve their practice to effectively meet the learning needs of their students. The advantages of reflective practice to trainers have been described as:

-   It helps trainers to take informed actions that can be justified and explained to others and that can be used to guide further action.
-   It allows trainers to adjust and respond to issues.
-   It helps trainers to become aware of their underlying beliefs and assumptions about learning and teaching.
-   It helps trainers promote a positive learning environment.
-   It allows trainers to consciously develop a repertoire of relevant and context-specific strategies and techniques.
-   It helps trainers locate their teaching in the broader institutional, social and political context and to appreciate that many factors influence student learning.

There have been three attitudes described that form the basis of reflective practice, namely:

-   open-mindedness - a willingness to consider new evidence as it occurs and to admit the possibility of error. It involves being open to other points of view, appreciating that there are many ways of looking at a particular situation or event and staying open to changing one’s own viewpoint. Part of open-mindedness is being able to let go of needing to be right or wanting to win.
-   responsibility - the careful consideration of the consequences of one’s actions, especially as they affect students. It is the willingness to acknowledge that whatever one chooses to do (for example decisions about curriculum, instruction, assessment, organisation, management) will impact the lives of students in both foreseen and unforeseen ways.
-   wholeheartedness - a commitment to seek every opportunity to learn and a belief that one can always learn something new.

Consistent adoption of these attitudes (open- minded, responsible and wholehearted) have been found to lead to particular attributes in trainers. These trainers have been found to routinely:

-   reflect on and learn from experience
-   engage in ongoing inquiry
-   solicit feedback
-   remain open to alternative perspectives
-   assume responsibility for their own learning
-   take action to align with new knowledge and understandings
-   observe themselves in the process of thinking
-   are committed to continuous improvement in practice
-   strive to align behaviour with values and beliefs
-   seek to discover what is true.
-   Essential modes of, and lenses for, reflection.

Reflective practice is undertaken not just to revisit the past but to guide future action. Reflective practitioners use all four of the essential modes of reflection:

-   Reflection-in-action is taking note of thinking and actions as they are occurring and making immediate adjustments as events unfold. Re-evaluation occurs on the spot.
-   Reflection-on-action is looking back on and learning from experience or action in order to affect future action. Reflecting after an event is probably the most frequently used form of reflection.
-   Reflection-for-action involves analysing practices with the purpose of taking action to change. It includes reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action. This type of reflection is proactive in nature. Often called 'closing the gap' reflection, it focuses on closing the gap between what is and what might be.
-   Reflection-within is inquiring about personal purposes, intentions and feelings. Teachers might question what is working well, what's keeping them from taking action, what's keeping their perspective limited, or why they reacted in a particular way. This is very similar to self-reflection.

Reflection can occur through any of four different lenses. Each lens will guide the reflection along a different path of enquiry and lead the teacher to a different set of responses. Not all lenses are required for all challenges, but they can be useful to consider:

-   The autobiographical lens (self) - open-mindedness - a willingness to consider new evidence as it occurs and to admit the possibility of error. It involves being open to other points of view, appreciating that there are many ways of looking at a particular situation or event and staying open to changing one's own viewpoint. Part of open-mindedness is being able to let go of needing to be right or wanting to win.
-   The student lens - This lens allows teachers to view their practice from students’ perspectives and is often a consistently surprising element for teachers. Both self-reflection and engaging with student feedback may reveal aspects of teaching practice that need adjustment.
-   The colleague lens - While good teachers will engage with the first two lenses, excellent teachers may also look to peers for mentoring, advice and feedback. Engaging with colleagues and hearing their perspectives allows teachers to check, reframe, and broaden theories of practice, and to consider new ideas and approaches. It also makes teachers aware that many of the challenges in teaching are common, which can be profoundly reassuring.
-   The theoretical lens (research and literature) - The fourth lens found in theoretical literature fosters critically reflective teaching. An engagement with both colleagues and scholarly literature supports teachers and also clarifies the contexts in which they teach. The theoretical literature extends understanding and appreciation of learning and teaching practices, and helps teachers to see the links between their personal development path and the broader educational context.

A lot of teachers engage in reflective practice, often in the car on the way home of an afternoon. When they get home the kids need a bath, dinner needs to be cooked and the dog has dug up something unmentionable. Immediately all their good ideas about how they could make that session even better next time evaporate. When the time comes to run that session, they forget to make the changes and run it the same as last time, make the same stumbles and hit the same awkward spots.

Developing the habit of recording your ideas and impressions is a useful habit to cultivate. Consider dedicating a notebook (digital or hardcopy) or developing a system of notating your session plan. Note down the things that went well, the things that didn’t go so well, the areas that could be changed and any other impressions you have of the session while they are still fresh.

## Action research

Action Research is a method of systematic enquiry that teachers undertake as researchers of their own practice. The enquiry involved in Action Research is a process involving the following key steps.

Action research begins with a review of current practice;

-   Identify an issue to be investigated;
-   Ask focused questions about how the issue can be investigates;
-   Imagine a way forward informed by research of the issue, discussion with experienced practitioners and self-reflection
-   Try it out (an intervention), and take stock of what happens (evaluation);
-   Modify the plan in light of what was found, and continue with the action;
-   Evaluate the modified action;
-   Reconsider what we are doing in light of the evaluation and communicate your findings with your peers.

This can then lead to a new action–reflection cycle.

The start of the process is usually an issue or situation that, as a trainer, you want to change. You can then turn this 'interesting problem' into a 'researchable question' and then developing actions to try out. You will draw on the findings of other researchers to help develop actions and interpret the consequences.

As an action researcher, or teacher-researcher, you will generate research. Enquiring into your practice will inevitably lead you to question the assumptions and values that are often overlooked during the course of normal teaching life. Assuming the habit of inquiry can become an ongoing commitment to learning and developing as a practitioner. As a teacher-researcher you assume the responsibility for being the agent and source of change.

# Online delivery

Since the pandemic, when synchronous online learning became much more widespread in VET, the skills of trainers and assessors have been pushed as they adapted to this new modality of delivery. Some teachers love it, others loath it, but all agree, it is not the same as being in the classroom and there is every chance you will find yourself delivering this type of training during your career.

In some ways, live online lessons are similar to traditional face-to-face classes — a teacher can present information and interact with a group of people in real time — in other ways, there are some important differences. Let’s take some time to explore them.

The first essential difference is in classroom management. In a physical classroom, the teacher is free to move the learners around, grouping them in different ways and laying out the class in a way that will make the activities run smoothly. Most online classes use conferencing software which can make breakout groups and different arrangements of learners possible in the classroom. Using these functions effectively requires some technical familiarity from the teacher and students. Often students will need some guidance and support for the first few times as they become familiar with the platform. With some creativity, most of the activities you would conduct in a classroom can be replicated in a synchronous, online environment

Another difference is in the use of back channels. Back channels are particularly popular in educational situations, such as lectures, where the audience are expected to sit and listen for a longer period of time. In the past lecturers often banned mobile phones from the lecture theatre, but nowadays progressive lecturers might even set up a twitter hashtag as a back channel for the audience. Online classrooms usually have a text function built in which can act as a back channel for the audience to make sure they are engaged. For this reason, it’s common to have both a presenter and host in lecture-style online lessons.

In online classes, lack of visual feedback is a common challenge for teachers. When presenting directly to an audience in the same room, we are able to adapt our delivery depending on visual feedback from the audience. A room full of bored faces is a sure sign to a presenter or teacher that they need to introduce a more interesting activity or adapt their delivery to engage the audience more. In the online classroom, a more astute presenter will make full use of the tools available to get similar feedback. Regular questions to the audience which they can respond to with voting tools are a useful way to check that the attendees are engaged in a live online session.

Students have a different experience in an online environment. For some, the pressure to familiarise themselves with new technology, particularly if their hardware or internet connection is letting them down can be a significant hurdle. Students will be on two learning curves – your content and the digital learning curve. Empathetic trainers will need to consider this and adjust their delivery and expectations accordingly.

The anonymity of not being physically present in a classroom can also be a benefit to learners attending online sessions. Learners who feel afraid to speak or raise their own issues in a physical classroom may often feel braver when they know they can’t be seen by other members of the class. Likewise, learners with a physical disability which limits their participation in traditional classroom activities are at no disadvantage in a virtual classroom where all participants are equal.

It is not just a case of picking up a session plan designed for a face to face environment and running with it in a synchronous, online environment. A great deal of thought, planning and consideration needs to go into converting face to face materials into an online format. Students will require a lot more sign posting of what they need to be doing, where they need to be looking, where they should be paying attention. Having these sign posts in as many different formats as possible can help – a verbal instruction, a written instruction of the screen and then a follow up instruction when they have navigated to where they need to be will all help.

There is an ever increasing range of videos designed to help trainers refine their teaching skills in an online environment at [Virtually the Trainer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQmRTrJQJyXq59ZKWV9Xqsw/videos).

# Record maintenance

ASQA oversees what we do in the VET sector and regulates training providers to ensure that national training standards are met. RTOs may also have state government reporting commitments and may be required to report to clients and employers. Maintaining up to date training and assessment records is required and a range of systems will be in place within an RTO to manage this.

**Record-management systems for training organisations**

Training records, the safety of employees, as well as any regulatory practices is a major element of compliance for all RTO’s

Reasons why a training organisation would use a record-management system

Compliance –

-   ASQA requirements
-   organisational policies and procedures
-   external bodies
-   for evaluation, review and continuous improvement

Evidence of training and assessments.

-   managing a learner from enrolment to completion
-   confirm learner progress
-   issuing of certificates

External monies/fund-

-   management of fee payments
-   external bodies such as apprenticeships
-   external funding for projects

Reporting requirements of these systems include:

Proof of training

-   Session plans
-   Learning programs – individual learning programs, workbased learning programs
-   Competency record books
-   Correspondence such as emails
-   Assessment records
-   Training needs analysis
-   Complaint and appeal records
-   Student feedback
-   Enrolment documents
-   Individual Learning Plans (ILPs)
-   Training and assessment documents (TAS)
-   Student progress
-   Student results and outcomes
-   Completed assessments
-   Validation records and reports

WHS

-   Risk assessment
-   Incident reports
-   Hazard inspections
-   Attendance Records ie proof of attendance
-   Roll registers (electronic or paperbased)
-   Medical certificates
-   Logging into LMS
-   Participation in web conferencing ie TEAMS. Adobe connect
-   Correspondence such as emails

To demonstrate that you have helped your RTO maintain compliant training and assessment strategies, you should be able to provide evidence of the following records.

## Assessment records

Your RTO and ASQA will also need to confirm that you have kept appropriate records of assessment.

The table below identifies the types of assessment records you need to maintain and the documents that could be used as evidence of these records

| Assessment records you need to maintain                                                                                        | Documents that could be used as evidence                               |

| Assessment decisions have been made based on the performance of the candidate and aligned to the relevant units of competency  | Assessment tools, records of completed assessments, validation reports |

## Safe and secure storage

Your records can be stored in hard copies or electronically. Whichever method you choose, your records need to be:

1.  Secure – for electronic records – using passwords, for paper based – the storage area should be locked
2.  Accessible only to appropriate stakeholders.

The timeframe you are required to maintain the records varies depending on the type of program and funding used. ASQA’s general direction requires that RTOs retain all completed assessment items for six months from the date on which the decision on competence for the individual unit was made. If the actual item cannot be retained (for example, a baked cake) then evidence, such as photographs, showing the standard of the work completed must be kept.

Training and assessment records may also be required:

1.  To respond to an appeal
2.  In the event of a serious accident to support whether the person was appropriately trained and assessed
3.  To support a claim for training funding
4.  To assist in determining completion rates and identify well-performing courses.

## Systems, process and practices

When developing work based learning, along with records maintenance, and RTO must also ensure that their systems (procedures), process and practises are in place

The systems, processes and practises their training organisation requires for work based learning are

Systems/procedures –

-   Ensure learners are correctly entered in RTO database system
-   Ensure student results are recorded in a timely manner
-   Correct documentation of learner participation
-   Learning management systems (used to support training)
-   IT systems (access productivity tools or software for tasks)
-   Record management systems (maintains information on the training or leaners)
-   Security systems (allow access to the site safely and securely
-   Systems to record student records and personnel details

Process

-   Confirmation of enrolment
-   Confirmation of delivery schedule
-   Providing clear information about the course they are studying
-   Explanation of expectations of learners
-   Ensuring assessments created are validated
-   ensure any resources used are also validated
-   Approval processes (formalise milestones and progress of learning)
-   Review process (review performance, skill levels and knowledge)
-   Communication process (mechanisms of communication such as meetings, emails, phone calls and notifications)

Practices

-   maintaining of vocational and education currency
-   maintaining of industry currency
-   ensure trainers and assessors are available to assist learners
-   providing detailed and supportive feedback to learners
-   employees through training)
-   Safety practices (such as WHS, confidentiality and privacy of data etc.)

# Introduction to the assess cluster

Welcome to your next cluster in yourTAE40116 Certificate IV in Training and Assessment – the deliver cluster.

In this cluster you will be covering three units of competency:

-   TAEASS401 - Plan assessment activities and processes (Release 2)
-   TAEASS402 - Assess competence (Release 2)
-   TAEASS403 - Participate in assessment validation (Release 2)
-   TAEASS502 - Design and develop assessment tools (Release 2)

You will develop the skills necessary to assess students in both a workplace context and in a classroom context. This will include

-   Designing and developing assessment tools
-   Planning assessment events
-   Conducting assessment events
-   Validating assessment tools

    You will be working more closely with training products during this cluster. If you have forgotten some of the material covered in the design cluster, now would be a good time to review and refresh your memory.

# Competency-based assessment

The method of assessment used in VET is competency-based assessment.

To be competent, a candidate is measured against a standard with the standard acting as the minimum level of achievement for all students. This standard can be from an internal workplace standard or a nationally accredited one, such as a unit of competency.

The candidate must demonstrate the knowledge and skills from the identified standard consistently over time. This means they must demonstrate their ability to perform practical tasks, describe or explain how the tasks are done and why they are done.

Assessment serves several purposes for the student, trainer, industry and employers. These include:

-   Determining whether a candidate is competent by the end of a training program
-   Providing feedback to trainers regarding the effectiveness of their teaching
-   Providing evidence to support the issuing of a licence
-   Recognising a student’s prior learning
-   To issue a student with a qualification or statement of attainment
-   Communicating the skills and knowledge of a student against a standard

The difference with competency-based assessment to other assessment methods is there is no grading or ranking. The candidate is either competent or not yet competent against the standard, and there is no comparison or ranking to other candidates.

If a candidate is not yet competent, they are often given further training or support and can undertake assessment again. An outcome of not yet competent is not equivalent to a fail.

Competency-based assessment sets a minimum standard that all candidates must achieve to receive a competent result. All students across the nation studying against a particular unit of competency will all be assessed against the same standard and qualifications will be consistent regardless of the RTO it was completed with. The use of a single set of standards nationally means that once a student has demonstrated they can mee that standard and has been awarded a competent result, all RTOs can be confident in that student’s ability in performing that task. This allows for units of competency awarded at one RTO to be recognised by another RTO through credit transfer and avoids a student having to be reassessed if they change RTOs for any reason.

Other types of assessment outside the VET sector include those that grade or rank the candidates. The assessments that rank students against other students are called norm-referenced assessments. In norm-referenced assessments, there may be only one candidate who can “pass” the assessment, for example, in a job interview.

Norm-referenced assessments rank candidates against each other, for example, in NSW, Higher School Certificate students receive an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank, (ATAR) which is a rank, not a mark. The ATAR indicates a student’s position relative to all the other HSC students. The university sector uses the ATAR to help select students for their courses.

Competing in the Olympics is a norm-referenced assessment; athletes are compared to other athletes. Only one athlete can win the gold medal.

A grading based assessment system uses a standard similar to competency based assessment, however with grading the standard sets out different levels of performance with the outcome reported against these levels. Higher Education in Australia often uses grading systems with results posted as usually a pass, credit, distinction or high distinction. Sitting behind these grades are rubrics that describe the quality of performance for each grade.

## Jargon

Some of the jargon in relation to assessment includes:

-   Learners/candidates
-   Trainers/assessors
-   VET
-   Competency-based assessment (CBA):
-   Competent (C)/Not yet competent (NYC) (used for unit outcomes only)
-   Satisfactory (S)/Not Satisfactory (NS) (used for assessment outcomes)
-   Norm based assessment
-   Evidence
-   Assessment tool
-   Assessment instrument.

## Evidence

A central part of competency-based assessment is the collection of evidence that supports the assessor’s decision. As assessors we can’t determine whether a candidate is competent or not, without the candidate providing us with evidence of their competence.

This evidence will be retained on file and can be used to validate and audit your assessment judgements in the future.

Evidence can take many forms and will typically be the student’s response to the assessment tasks. It may be their responses to knowledge questions, portfolios, project work or the assessor records of what was observed during role plays and demonstrations.

Evidence may be:

-   Direct
-   Indirect
-   Supplementary

Direct evidence is collected when the assessor actually observes the learner performing a specific task, for example operating a POS terminal or register. It could be listening to an audio tape or viewing a videotape of the learner's performance in the workplace, for example building a colour wall for merchandise presentation.

Indirect evidence is evidence of a candidate’s work that can be reviewed or examined by the assessor. This could include finished products, written assignments or tests, or a portfolio of previous work performed. Supplementary evidence is additional evidence presented to assessors to support a candidate’s claim of competence.

Supplementary evidence is Any other type of evidence that isn’t an example of the candidate’s but supports their claim of competence is considered supplementary evidence. This is most commonly used in RPL

# Assessor obligations

In the VET sector, assessment is based on competency. When you assess someone as competent, you are confirming the candidate has met all the requirements of the unit of competency.

It means the candidate has achieved the minimum standards to perform the workplace tasks, as agreed by industry.

Assessors conforming to assessor obligations maintain the value of the national system. This includes:

-   Following legislative requirements, including any training as a process of workers’ compensation, any legal contractual obligations for traineeships and apprentices
-   Ensuring assessment practice demonstrates a positive compliance posture by complying with the Standards for RTOs 2015, in particular Standard 1, by ensuring all requirements of the training product have been satisfied, and conducting assessment according to the Rules of Evidence and Principles of assessment
-   Complying to standards and any workplace agreements
-   Maintaining up to date skills and knowledge in the areas being taught in addition to VET practice
-   Acting ethically without any discrimination
-   Ensure their training provides graduates with the skills, knowledge and attributes expected by industry
-   Maintaining the privacy rights of the student by only disclosing assessment results to authorised persons or bodies, ensuring student records are accurate and meet reporting requirements, and comply with the RTOs privacy policy
-   Holding the required VET qualifications
-   Ensuring all assessment activities are safe and comply with WHS legislation

## Legislative requirements

There are laws to protect people. If a candidate you have assessed as competent breaches a rule, it can bring into question your professionalism.

Following are some examples of legislation that affect assessment:

### Legislation: WHS Act

**What the legislation requires**: The WHS Act is designed to keep people safe.

Every worker has an obligation to work in a safe manner. All your candidates must be able to perform the tasks safely to be competent.

**Impact**: People get hurt. Serious workplace accidents are investigated, which includes examining the training the worker received and whether they are competent at the task.

### Legislation: Responsible service of alcohol or gambling

**What the legislation requires**: Rules around serving alcohol or gambling.

**Impact:** There are serious fines for people who breach these rules.

There are also rules around apprenticeships and trainees. Make yourself aware of the rules and only assess candidates as competent when they comply with the legislation.

Other relevant legislative requirements include:

-   Anti-discrimination Act 1977 (NSW)
-   Privacy Act 1998 (Cth)
-   Apprenticeship and Traineeship Act 2001 (NSW)
-   Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (NSW)

## Complying with standards

There are many standards used to ensure quality. These can include industry standards, which include specifications for products. Check which standards apply in your industry area. Ensure candidates’ products meet these standards.

An example follows.

**Industry:** Electrotechnology.

**Standard:** AS/NZS 3000:2018 Wiring Rules.

**What the standard requires**: All low voltage wiring installations need to follow the guidelines in the standard.

All RTOs must follow the Standards for RTOs 2015. Standard 1 is particularly relevant to assessors:

**Standard 1. The RTO’s training and assessment strategies and practices are responsive to industry and student needs and meet the requirements of training packages and VET accredited courses**

**Clause 1.8 to 1.12 – Conduct effective assessment[^39]**

[^39]: <https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2017C00663>

You must follow your RTOs system, which ‘ensures assessment judgements are consistently made on a sound basis.’[^40]

[^40]: <https://www.asqa.gov.au/standards>

The entire unit of competency must be assessed.

## Acting ethically

There is a Code of Practice to support professionally responsible and ethical assessment practice. The code is loosely based on an international code developed by the US-based National Council for Measurement in Education.

The **Code of Practice** requires the assessor to:

-   Identify and handle different needs and requirements for:
    -   Candidates
    -   Local enterprises
    -   Industry
-   Identify, and refer where necessary, conflict of interest
-   Avoid harassment
-   Rights of the candidate:
    -   Make candidates aware of their rights and processes of appeal
    -   Protect the rights of the candidate
-   Not allow personal or interpersonal factors to influence the assessment outcomes

# Assessment tools

This topic will give you tips to review the quality of existing assessment tools and develop assessment tools. An assessment tool is the collection of everything required to assess one or more units of competency.

**A good way to explain the difference between an assessment tool and an assessment instruments, is to think of an orchestra (the tool) with its vast array of beautiful musical equipment (the instruments).**

The **assessment tools** have three components that you are required develop, including:

-   **Assessment instruments** - These contain the:
    -   Assessment conditions
    -   Tasks the students need to complete
    -   Feedback section
-   **Instructions to the candidate –** this explains the expectations of the assessment to the candidate
-   **Marking guide** - this contains the:
    -   Instructions for the assessor
    -   An outline of evidence to be gathered from the candidate
    -   Model answers and examples
-   **Mapping** - This lists how all the parts of the unit of competency will be assessed.

## Assessment instruments

The assessment instruments are used to gather and record the candidate’s evidence.

You will need to assess:

-   Knowledge
-   Skills/performance.

Typically, skills and knowledge are both integrated into a skills-based assessment instrument and knowledge is assessed separately and explicitly in a knowledge-based assessment instrument. This means that at a minimum you will require one knowledge assessment instrument and one skills instrument. Reflect on the assessments you have completed for this course so far – each cluster has had a series of knowledge questions and a series of skills tasks.

A mixture of assessment instrument templates will help you to gather the evidence you require such as:

-   Knowledge questions – written and/or verbal
-   Case study/scenario
-   Simulated activity
-   Portfolio
-   Project – either simulated or work related
-   Demonstrations/observations
-   Third party report (only used for RPL)

Each type of instrument above is referred to as a method of assessment.

Which instruments you choose to determine competence will depend on:

-   The ability of the instrument/s to capture evidence which meets the Rules of Evidence and Principles of Assessment. We will examine these concepts in the next chapters
-   The resource requirements to apply the instrument. For example, access to a circus may be difficult for a performing arts student, whereas access to a gymnastics centre is likely to be more feasible
-   The context that the tool will be used. For example a tool to be used in a workplace, or online will look different to a tool to be used in a face to face classroom
-   The cost of implementing different instruments will vary and needs to be considered to ensure the assessment will be viable.

Assessment instruments are likely to undergo changes, so make sure if you are developing assessment instruments that the version is evident and updated when changes are made. Always check the version before using an assessment instrument and verify you have the latest version.

## Candidate Instructions

All assessment instruments need clear candidate instructions. Candidate instructions can include:

-   When and where the assessment event will be held
-   The target student for the assessment
-   The purpose of the assessment
-   The timeframe they must complete the assessment in
-   What they are being assessed on and the criteria
-   The tasks to be completed and assessment methods
-   Resources they require to complete assessment
-   Requirements for correctly using, maintaining and storing PPE
-   Who the assessor will be
-   Their rights as a candidate
-   What to include as evidence
-   The conditions and context that the assessment must be conducted in
-   How to submit the evidence
-   How to present the evidence
-   Reasonable adjustment considerations
-   Opportunities for RPL
-   How they will be marked
-   How their results will be recorded
-   How they will be given feedback
-   Plagiarism
-   Appeals process.

Use short sentences in plain English.

### The context and conditions of assessment

The context and conditions of assessment clarify the target group and purpose of the tool and is recorded in instructions for the assessor, the student and any contributing third party.

The instructions should be appropriate for the reader. The instructions can be included with the assessment instrument or attached as a separate document. The context and conditions of assessment considers those characteristics of the student cohort that may impact on performance. For example, an assessment tool could be developed to cater for particular language, literacy and numeracy requirements; a student’s workplace experience; or other student needs that require reasonable adjustment. The context of the assessment may also take into account assessments already completed, and the competencies demonstrated in these assessments.

By looking at context you can consider the conditions under which evidence for assessment must be gathered. Training package requirements and industry consultation may identify conditions to be considered when conducting assessment such as:

-   equipment or material requirements
-   contingencies
-   specifications
-   physical conditions
-   costs associated with conducting the task
-   the location of the students and the delivery mode of the training
-   relationships with team members and supervisors
-   relationships with clients/customers
-   timeframes for completion.

Any conditions should be clarified in the instructions to ensure consistency in the application of the assessment.

## Assessment Methods

### Knowledge assessment

Units of competency require evidence to show a depth of knowledge. The knowledge will be specified in the Knowledge Evidence section of the unit of competency. A knowledge assessment can include:

-   Short answer questions
-   True or false questions
-   Multiple choice questions.

Multiple choice questions are not the most reliable method of assessment as the candidate may guess the answer. They are also very difficult to write reliably for higher level qualifications. You have been asked to answer multiple choice questions through this qualification. These questions have been through at least nine levels of quality assurance, despite this there are still concerns raised from time to time.

Questions that require a candidate to apply a concept by providing an example are preferred. Short answer questions will typically be written very similarly to multiple choice questions but will draw on different verbs. Short answer questions will use verbs such as describe, explain, outline etc.

True/False questions need to be written very differently. These questions will have an instructional statement, eg: “Read the statements below and indicate whether they are true or false”. Each line item after these instructions then needs to be written as a clear and definitive statement. They cannot be written as questions which is a common mistake.

### Demonstration, practical skill task and observation

Units of competency require evidence to show the skills required to complete tasks. This is usually in the form of a demonstration. Role plays (although usually loathed by candidates and assessors alike), skill tests, and direct observations are all valuable approaches to skills assessments. Unit requirements specifying interaction with others can only be assessed via observation, either direct or recorded. The unit of competency will also determine the extent or amount of evidence required to show competence and a simulated work environment may be required. Assessments can be contextualised to reflect the workplace context for students.

### Portfolios

Portfolios are a great way of gathering evidence that shows the application of theory. Answers will vary between candidates, as the candidate applies the theory to their own situation. Auditors still expect to see guidance for the assessor with portfolio assessments specifying what a minimum quality of a satisfactory submission would include. For portfolio assessments, provide examples of what a completed, satisfactory portfolio might look like. When templates are provided, state whether all the fields in the templates need to be completed. Often a field in a template is mapped to the unit of competency and is required to be completed to ensure all components of the unit of competency are assessed. For example:

**Portfolio item: Risk assessment**

Item required to be completed for assessment: Risk assessment template

Advice to assessors: The candidate will complete a risk assessment of their workshop/classroom. Hazards, risks and control measures will vary depending on the workshop or classroom

Example provided: Completed risk assessment is provided to demonstrate the type of evidence required in each section of the template.

### Case Study

A case study can be an engaging assessment instrument but should be used sparingly, particularly those that only require a written response. Such case studies are hypothetical situations and how a student says they will respond, versus their actual behaviour in that situation can differ significantly. It can be argued that case studies requiring a written response only are assessing a candidate’s knowledge of how they *should* respond, not their actual skills. Case studies used to provide a work context or acting as a prompt for a role play, or some other interaction skill demonstration, or a project are far more reliable and useful. Consider how the optional case studies have been used for your assessment throughout this course.

### Projects and product-based methods

Projects and product-based methods will often require students to demonstrate their skills in an extensive task that will require work over an extended period outside of the classroom. Examples include when research and planning is required or when the assessment is based on a simulated organisation and extended case study. Projects typically demand students apply the skills and knowledge they have learnt in a concrete fashion through an in-depth exploration of the concepts. A project may need a case study to provide a context for students who do not have a context of their own. Answers will vary between candidates, as the candidate applies the theory to their own situation. Auditors still expect to see guidance for the assessor with project assessments specifying what a minimum quality of a satisfactory submission would include. For project assessments, provide examples of what a completed project of a satisfactory standard might look like.

## Marking guides

Marking guides ensure the intent of the assessment tool is met[^41]. Marking guides include assessor instructions, which may include:

[^41]: <https://www.asqa.gov.au/sites/g/files/net3521/f/Guide_to_developing_assessment_tools.pdf>

-   What the candidate must provide
-   What the assessor must provide
-   Information on how to organise the assessment.

### Model answers

Your marking guides should contain model answers.

For knowledge questions, the marking guide will give direction on what a suitable answer would include. This may include an example answer. Where a candidate is required to give a number of examples the marking guide will indicate how many answers must be received and give a list of possible responses. The model answer may also include responses that are commonly provided that are incorrect

For example:

**Question:** List two learner characteristics that you may have to consider when designing training.

**Model answer**: The candidate must provide two examples. They may include, but are not limited to, any two of the following:

-   
-   Age
-   Occupation
-   Cultural/language background
-   Educational background or general knowledge
-   Gender
-   Language, literacy and numeracy needs
-   Physical ability
-   Socio-economic background
-   Previous experience with the topic
-   Work and parental commitments
-   Attitude to learning.

Where a particular response is required, the model answer will state what must be included.

## Assessment mapping

As you review or write assessment tools, map the instruments to the entire unit of competency. Your mapping should make it clear:

-   Which assessment event covers the criteria
-   All verbs and subsections within the criteria must be covered. For example, if the criteria says to “chair” a meeting, having students all “participate” in a meeting will not be sufficient. Each student will need to demonstrate their skills in “chairing” a meeting
-   Where there are multiple verbs and subsections, you may need multiple questions or multiple pieces of evidence
-   The evidence mapped to each criteria will need to consider the foundation skills mapped to that criteria. If the foundation skills maps a criteria as requiring oral communication skills, you cannot map this criteria exclusively to written tasks, there must be oral communication included
-   What question or task number addresses the criteria. This may require you to consider how you will impose clear numbering systems throughout your instruments

**Note**: Recording ticks against assessment events will not be acceptable in an audit.

At Certificate IV level and below, most of the assessment evidence should be skill-based. Questions are used where the criteria cannot be reliably observed. Whatever assessment methods are used, they must be mapped to the unit requirements.

The following is an example of the parts of a mapping document.

### Sample assessment mapping

## Process for developing assessment tools

A suggested process for developing assessment tools is below:

-   Select the unit of competency and closely read all components to ensure you are familiar with the unit and are aware of any unanticipated demands
-   Set up your mapping template by copying and pasting over all your information
-   Reread the unit highlighting the verbs (use one colour for knowledge-based verbs and a different colour for skills-based verbs)
-   Identify the opportunities for contextualisation, define the intended student cohort and define the context of the assessment including who will collect the evidence and where it will be collected.
-   Select the assessment methods that will be appropriate for the unit, ensuring you have at least one knowledge-based method and at least one skills-based method. Your decision will be guided by the requirements of the unit, the intended context of the assessment tool, and the conditions of assessment from the unit of competency. Consider how the evidence will be collected against the selected methods.
-   Discuss your intended design with peers, client, or other assessors to check your plans are feasible
-   Work through your knowledge highlighted aspects of the unit developing questions. Be aware of opportunities for a cleverly worded question to cover multiple demands – but don’t over stretch
-   Map each question to the unit as you go. Keep notes for any areas you would like to revisit and strengthen.
-   Copy and paste your knowledge instrument and rename it as a Marking Guide. Provide sample answers to the questions. Doing this after you are completely happy with your instrument means you have fewer version control risks that mean your marking guide becomes different from your instrument. We’ve all learnt this the hard way.
-   Develop your candidate instructions and your assessor instructions
-   Consider the skills-based verbs and if necessary separate them out into what requirements can be met in what skills-based instruments. For example if you are conducting a role play and a direct observation, categorise what requirements will be covered in the role play and what will be covered in the observation.
-   Complete your skills-based instruments, mapping as you go.
-   Develop your supporting materials such as case studies, role descriptions for role plays, scenarios and simulations.
-   Develop your candidate instructions.
-   Develop your assessor instructions making sure to describe how you expect the instrument to be administered, the expected equipment and facilities that will be required, and any tasks the assessor will need to undertake before the assessment can be conducted. Your assessor instructions may also include the administration, recording and reporting requirements associated with the tools
-   Develop your Marking Guides for your skills-based instruments detailing what the assessor should look for as a minimum for observation and role play activities.
-   Ensure your instruments all satisfy the Rule of Evidence and Principles of Assessment. Ensure your knowledge-based instrument is only assessing knowledge.Ensure all your skill-based requirements are included in your skills-based instruments. Ensure your instruments are suitable for your specified context
-   Conduct quality assurance on your tool. This could include having someone complete it and provide feedback, having it validated or having it reviewed by a peer or colleague.
-   Modify your instruments based on feedback. Be careful of version control from your instruments to marking guided.

## Integrating assessment activities

Within a unit of competency, there will be related components.

Across different units of competency, there is often the same or similar components. In the TAE40116 qualification these are some of the repeated requirements from the units of competency:

-   Candidate characteristics
-   Consultation
-   AQF
-   Rules of evidence
-   Principles of assessment
-   Review.

Nearly every unit of competency has work health and safety requirements.

You can integrate related items from a unit of competency, requiring the candidate to address a number of steps that provide evidence for multiple aspects of the unit of competency, rather than individually assess every criterion for each unit of competency.

You can cluster the assessment of units of competency by using the same activity to assess components from more than one unit of competency. This means one assessment instrument may assess aspects of more than one unit of competency.

Clustering or integrating makes the assessment more realistic to workplace application and saves the candidate repeatedly undertaking the same or similar assessment tasks. This also saves the assessor time in assessing. Take a look at the following example.

| First unit of competency name and reference | Second unit of competency name and reference | Summary of overlapping component                                                   | Assessment method                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TAEASS401  2.1                              | TAEASS402  1.2                               | Interpret/analyse units of competency to identify/confirm evidence to be collected | Activity which involves accessing a unit of competency and recording what evidence you will require |

## Trial and review the assessment tools

Before using any assessment tools, it is advisable to trial them. You could:

-   Ask a colleague to complete the assessment
-   Give it to a small group of learners as a learning activity
-   Have a colleague review it against the Rules of evidence and Principles of assessment
-   Validation with an appropriate panel after the tool has been used to ensure compliance

Discuss the assessment tools with the trial group. This will reveal if any instructions need improving.

The most common way of checking whether an assessment meets all the criteria before it is used to make a judgement of competency is to complete a pre-assessment validation.

All components of the assessment tool should be continuously monitored for effectiveness, compliance and improvement opportunities

# Rules of evidence

The Standards for RTOs 2015 state that assessment must meet the rules of evidence.

Evidence used to make a judgement of competency must meet the following.

**Summary of the rules of evidence**

| Rules of evidence | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Valid**         | The evidence must collectively cover all the skills and knowledge described in the relevant unit of competency (or benchmark for assessment).  The skills required must be demonstrated in a real or simulated workplace.                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Current**       | The evidence must be from the present (or very recent past). For recognition, the general currency rule is three to five years. Changes in legislation, however, may mean a candidate’s evidence is not still current in three to five years. Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) - general currency rule is that evidence up to three to five years old may be considered. |
| **Sufficient**    | There must be enough evidence to ensure that all parts of the relevant unit(s) have been satisfied and that competence can be demonstrated repeatedly over a period of time. (The evidence guide from a unit of competency is often a prescriptive guide for this.)                                                                                                         |
| **Authentic**     | You must be assured that it is the candidate’s own work. Assessments that require you to directly observe the candidate will help you to confirm the authenticity of the evidence.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The way you design assessment instruments can assist in ensuring these rules of evidence are met. For example:

-   Include observation of assessing skills. This will mean the evidence is valid, current and authentic
-   Use formative assessment. Assessing over time will help you get sufficient evidence.

## Activity 76.1: Applying the rules of evidence

Using [www.training.gov.au](http://www.training.gov.au) review the performance criteria and elements for the unit of competency [SITXCCS006 - Provide service to customers (Release 1)](https://training.gov.au/Training/Details/SITXCCS006).

For each of the following candidates, examine their evidence and decide whether it meets the assessment criteria of validity, sufficiency, currency and authenticity. Use the table provided to decide whether each candidate is competent, or needs to provide more evidence.

**Candidate 1**: This candidate has provided a statement from a private RTO that indicates participation in a short course in cross-cultural communication four years ago.

**Candidate 2**: This candidate has provided a statement from his employer at a small hotel. It states that the hotel has a wide range of customers and he always deals with them well. The employer is a qualified assessor.

**Candidate 3**: The candidate has provided results of a test she completed as part of an introductory translation course. She scored 80% in the test.

**Candidate 4**: The candidate has provided a copy of an observation checklist from another assessment task he did in a TAFE business course two years ago. The checklist was for a role-play about dealing with difficult customers.

# Principles of assessment

The Standards for Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) 2015 require assessments to be based on the principles of assessment.

| Fairness    | The individual learner’s needs are considered in the assessment process. Reasonable adjustments take into account the individual learner’s needs. The RTO informs the learner about the assessment process and provides the learner with the opportunity to challenge the result of the assessment and be re-assessed if necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flexibility | Assessment is flexible to the individual learner by:  reflecting the learner’s needs;  assessing competencies held by the learner no matter how or where they have been acquired; and drawing from a range of assessment methods and using those that are appropriate to the context, the unit of competency and associated assessment requirements, and the individual.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Validity    | Any assessment decision of the RTO is justified, based on the evidence of the performance of the individual learner.  Validity requires:  assessment against the unit/s of competency and the associated assessment requirements covers the broad range of skills and knowledge that are essential to competent performance;  assessment of knowledge and skills is integrated with their practical application;  assessment to be based on evidence that demonstrates that a learner could demonstrate these skills and knowledge in other similar situations; and  judgement of competence is based on evidence of learner performance that is aligned to the unit/s of competency and associated assessment requirements. |
| Reliability | Evidence presented for assessment is consistently interpreted, and assessment results are comparable irrespective of the assessor conducting the assessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Activity 77.1: Applying the principles of assessment

For each principle, give an example of how you could meet it. An example has been given.

# Reasonable adjustment

Assessors are required to make reasonable adjustments to assessments to ensure they meet the needs of the candidate. Reasonable adjustments are made to cater for literacy levels, cultural background, physical abilities and experiences of the candidates.

Reasonable adjustment refers to any modification made to the training/assessment environment, certification requirements, training delivery or assessment method used to help students with disability access and participate in education and training on the same basis as those without a disability.

## Compliance and reasonable adjustment

RTOs are obliged by law to make reasonable adjustments to ensure maximum participation of students with a disability. Adjustment is a **legislative** term. We must allow adjustment to an assessment process to give candidates:

-   Access to an assessment
-   Opportunities to successfully complete an assessment.

Adjustments are considered reasonable if the intent of the unit is still being met, and all the requirements of the unit of competency are assessed. The golden rule is, you cannot alter the performance criteria.

Reasonable adjustment often involves changing the method of assessment to remove a barrier to the candidate. The following are some examples of reasonable adjustment.

| Candidate characteristics                                                                                                             | Reasonable adjustment                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The candidate lives in a remote area and cannot physically meet the assessor                                                          | Candidate submits a recording of them undertaking the assessment task The evidence is supported by a third-party report from their workplace supervisor and participates in oral questioning with the assessor through video conferencing |
| The candidate uses a wheelchair and cannot reach the standard workbench in the workshop                                               | Assessor provides a lowered workbench with all the tools accessible                                                                                                                                                                       |
| English is Raj’s second language. He needs time to translate English into his first language and to translate his answer into English | Allow more time for assessment Use plain English Use interpreter                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Mia has just left school and has no work experience to draw from                                                                      | The assessor provides a case study that Mia can extract information from and respond to, demonstrating she has the knowledge and skills required for the unit of competency                                                               |
| Ben is hearing impaired and communicates primarily in Auslan                                                                          | The assessor provides an Auslan interpreter and a notetaking scribe                                                                                                                                                                       |

You still must be able to prove that the assessment criteria are being met. For example, if the unit requires documentation, then the student must provide evidence of writing. It would be reasonable, however, to provide a template to the candidate in plain English that reduces the requirement for writing.

# Assessment plan

Assessment planning is vital in the VET sector:

-   Funding tends to be tied to assessment outcomes
-   Assessment may be required to comply with legal requirements
-   Stakeholders require the assessment for a purpose.

The assessment plan documents all the important aspects of assessment in one place. A plan minimises the chance of something being missed and problems occurring with the assessment process.

Following is an example of an assessment plan. It outlines the type of information to be included and gives an example.

| Planning Item                                                                                       | Details |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| **Unit Code, title and release number**                                                             |         |
| **Where would be an appropriate venue to assess this unit?**                                        |         |
| **What resources are required for the assessment and will the candidate or assessor provide them?** |         |
| **How long will the assessment event take per candidate?**                                          |         |

## Context

The following are examples of context:

-   Assessment will be conducted in the workplace
-   Assessment will be conducted in the classroom using simulated conditions
-   Assessment will be conducted in a synchronous online environment
-   Assessment is through RPL.

## Estimated costs

There may be resource requirements and associated costs, for example, raw products required in construction, ingredients for cooking, and so on.

Calculate costs for single-use and perishable items and record these on your plan.

# Candidate briefing

Why do we brief candidates before an assessment? Briefing candidates before an assessment involves a two-way consultative process to confirm:

-   The candidate’s roles, rights and responsibilities
-   The assessor’s roles, rights and responsibilities.

Candidates have the right to:

-   Be informed about assessments
-   A fair assessment
-   Participate in an assessment event (provided they meet any required pre-requisites)
-   Confidentiality regarding assessment results and records
-   A safe assessment
-   Withdraw prior to attempting an assessment
-   Stop an assessment
-   Appeal an assessment decision
-   Another opportunity to be assessed, if assessed as “Not Yet Satisfactory” on their first attempt.

It is the candidate’s responsibility to:

-   Confirm that they are prepared for the assessment
-   Ask questions if they do not understand
-   Notify the assessor if they need a reasonable adjustment, in a timely manner
-   Prepare for an assessment, attend and make genuine efforts to complete the assessment.

## Assessor qualities

Assessor qualities required when briefing a candidate include:

-   Knowledge about the assessment tasks and processes
-   Communication skills
-   Empathy
-   Listening skills
-   Questioning skills
-   Being inclusive
-   Demonstrating a duty of care toward the candidate.

## Timeline

The briefing process for candidates begins well before the day of assessment.

**On the day the course begins**

Introduce the course and briefly describe the assessment:

-   Events
-   Requirements
-   Time frames.

**During the course**

Share specific and detailed information about the assessment, including:

-   Tasks, requirements and what candidates will need to do to demonstrate competency during each assessment
-   Opportunities and methods candidates may use to contact you to confirm the assessment arrangements/conditions
-   The specific assessment dates
-   Any opportunities to practise tasks involved in the assessment events.

**On the day of the assessment**

There is a lot to remember during an assessment. Creating and following a checklist will help you keep on track.

A sample checklist has been provided below. It is recommended that you modify this checklist to suit you and the events you are assessing.

The checklist below has been created for briefing multiple candidates who will be simultaneously completing assessments. The assessments are made up of two assessment events, knowledge-based questions and a skills-based observation assessment, based on a unit of competency.

**Candidate briefing checklist**

As a minimum, you should cover the following:

| Behaviour observed                                                                                                                       |

| Give opportunity for questions                                                                                                           |
| Arrange submission of documentary evidence                                                                                               |
| Arrange time for skills assessment                                                                                                       |

# Assess competence

In the VET sector, assessment is the process of formally gathering evidence to make a judgment about whether a candidate meets **all** the requirements of a unit of competency.

Planning is critical. Before starting to assess competence:

-   Read through the assessment plan
-   Familiarise yourself with the assessment tools
-   Check if the assessment provides any further opportunities for holistic assessment through integrating units
-   Organise all the requirements for the assessment. For example, personal protective clothing and equipment (PPCE), access to a workshop and machinery
-   Brief the candidate. Remember to:
    -   Check if the candidate has any special needs
    -   Check they are ready for the assessment
    -   Answer any questions regarding the assessment before you begin the assessment process
    -   Provide information regarding the assessment, including the appeals process
    -   Outline WHS requirements or considerations relevant to the assessment.

## Gather evidence

The evidence collected and then documented will become a record of the event. This record can be used for audit purposes. It can also be used in the event of an appeal. It is the paperwork that is often the first point of reference used in the event of an appeal.

Use your assessment tools to demonstrate the assessment process you went through to make a decision.

The following table outlines different assessment methods, instruments and tips for their use.

| Assessment method    | Assessment instrument                                                               | Evidence recording tips                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **RPL**              | RPL questions, RPL portfolio checklist                                              | As an initial step, get the candidate to complete a self-assessment Review the self-assessment and make a recommendation regarding whether they should proceed with RPL.  Map all portfolio items received - you may not need to ask all the questions as you may see evidence within the portfolio items                                                      |

## Professional judgement

You are a professional. You have been employed as an assessor because of your expertise in the field you are assessing. Where examples and short answers to questions are required, you will need to judge whether the answers are in-depth enough for the AQF level you are assessing. If you are unsure, ask another assessor in your field for their opinion.

In some situations, a candidate will give you an answer in one section; however, you expected to hear the answer in another section. Use your professional judgement to decide if you can make reference to this section in your marking, making the answer satisfactory.

If you assess an assessment task as not yet satisfactory, you will need to decide whether the entire assessment event or just a portion of the task needs to be repeated. For example, if the candidate missed an item in a model, you might require them to be assessed on the whole model again, not just the one component they missed. In accounting, you would get them to fix the initial error but not necessarily the consequential or cascading errors that occurred because of the initial error.

## Mistakes assessors make

There are some common mistakes assessors can make, and it is helpful to be aware of them:

-   **Candidate bias** – Be careful not to allow a candidate’s personality to colour your judgement on their competency. Sometimes known as the halo or horn effect, it can be quite easy for an assessor to assume a candidate can do no wrong (halo effect) or the reverse. Judge the evidence you have, not the perception.
-   **Competency due to quantity** – Do not be tempted to lean towards a competent result based on quantity. Particularly in RPL situations, candidates can swamp you with evidence. You must map all the evidence and be confident you have the range and depth of evidence required.
-   **Marking for jargon** – Just because a candidate uses an industry term, it does not mean they understand what it means to apply it. Alternatively, a candidate may describe the situation perfectly but fail to use the industry terminology. As assessors, we are not trying to produce dictionaries. Competency is reserved for those who can apply knowledge and skills.
-   **Accepting unverified documents** – You must see originals of qualifications or copies authenticated by a Justice of the Peace. Third-party reports should contain contact numbers to enable you to check their validity.
-   **All or nothing RPL** – Often people have a long history in an industry, but may not be familiar with the latest trends or the most recent changes in legislation. These candidates can be acknowledged for their existing expertise and given a gap assessment for the newer areas.

## Other requirements

When assessing, you must make sure you meet:

-   The principle of assessment
-   Rules of evidence
-   Dimensions of competency
-   Requirements to accept the results of a unit of competency already held – Where a candidate holds a transcript for a unit of competency, you must complete a credit transfer for the student, and they are not required to be assessed on the unit again.

You must use multiple forms of evidence and different methods of assessment to be confident of the candidate’s competency.

## Activity 81.1: Assess competence

Your candidate has to answer the phone according to store policy to be competent. You have developed a checklist to assess his competency, and he does everything right but leaves out one step. He does not check back with the customer every thirty seconds while the customer is on hold.

1.  This missed step does not prevent the call from ultimately being successful. Is your candidate competent?

    Explain your answer.

# Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)

Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is a formal documented assessment process. Candidates are eligible for RPL when they already have the skills and knowledge to meet the requirements of the unit of competency. An RPL process does not involve training unless gaps in evidence are identified during the RPL process.

The evidence received for RPL will vary between each candidate. This does not mean the candidate has to figure it out for themselves. RPL is a guided process. It normally consists of a:

-   Self-assessment
-   Competency conversation
-   Portfolio of evidence
-   Third-party report
-   Direct observation/challenge test.

The assessor provides information on the types of information that would be suitable. You must be confident that what you have requested will cover the entire unit of competency. The suggested evidence can be mapped to check for sufficiency. More important is the mapping of the actual evidence received, because the evidence received will vary. A partial example of a template that can be used to check that the requested and received evidence will adequately address the unit of competency is below.

### Proposed Evidence

Map the unit of competency to the instruments:

-   Record the portfolio reference numbers from the portfolio instrument you created, next to the unit of competency component, where there is a choice use “or” and enclose the option in a bracket. Where an option requires more than one piece of evidence bracket together.
-   Record the question numbers from your question bank next to the unit of competency component

**Submitted Evidence,** following receipt of actual evidence from the candidate:

-   Record the portfolio reference number of the evidence received next to the unit of competency component (note this may mean the candidate's portfolio items are not sequential and not all items are required)
-   Record the question numbers of the actual questions used next to the unit of competency component
-   Record S for Satisfactory or US for unsatisfactory to indicate whether the portfolio evidence received and the questions answered meet the requirements.

Once the mapping of the received evidence is complete, an outcome of RPL Granted or RPL Not Granted is recorded.

The following are examples of RPL instruments.

### Self-assessment

Providing a self-assessment to the candidate allows the candidate to quickly determine whether they are likely to have enough evidence for RPL. A self-assessment informally lists requirements of the unit of competency. While the self assessment can give a candidate useful insight, it cannot be relied upon as evidence of competency. An example of a self-assessment is below.

| **Performance evidence** Rate the experience you currently have.                                          | **None** | **Some** | **Plenty** |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|------------|
| I have prepared, delivered and evaluated at least two presentations                                       |          |          |            |
| I have used aids and materials to support the presentation                                                |          |          |            |
| I have knowledge of and used effective communication principles                                           |          |          |            |
| I have reviewed the effectiveness of my presentations and made improvements to the original presentations |          |          |            |

| **Knowledge Evidence** Rate the knowledge you currently have.                                           | **None** | **Some** | **Plenty** |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|------------|
| I can use methods to collect and review presentation feedback                                           |          |          |            |
| I can identify regulatory and organisational obligations and requirements                               |          |          |            |
| I can describe the principles of effective communication and a range of presentation aids and materials |          |          |            |

| **Tell us how you meet the performance and knowledge evidence criteria – this must be completed **For example, provide details of your work experience (paid or unpaid) |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                                                                                                                         |

### RPL portfolio

An RPL portfolio will often include:

-   A resume with dates that indicate when the candidate was using the skills required by the unit of competency and a range of applications
-   A position description
-   Workplace documents, which are planning documents or records of tasks taking place. For example, job cards. Your RPL portfolio should give suggestions for suitable workplace evidence. The example given below gives suggestions for specific workplace documents that map to the unit of competency.

Refer to the TAE40116 Student RPL for an example of how TAFE NSW puts this information into a usable format for students. Your teacher will advise where you can locate a copy. A partial example of a portfolio template is below. Note the example provides a choice of suitable evidence.

### Third-party report

RPL often deals with evidence from the past. A third party report is generally part of the evidence that is used to ensure the other evidence provided is the candidate’s own work (authentic) and current. Well-structured third party reports help ensure the criteria from the unit of competency is addressed.

Do not copy and paste the information directly from a unit of competency into a third party report. Ensure you use plain English and customise the report to suit the unit and what you would like the third party to confirm. Requesting examples of how the skill was applied in the workplace is more reliable than tick boxes. The following is an excerpt from a third party report.

| Workplace skill/knowledge Your employee…                                                                            | Application of the skill in the workplace |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Plans presentations and intended outcomes (1.1)                                                                     |                                           |
| Explains outcomes of the presentation and provides opportunities for participants to seek clarification (2.1, 2.5)  |                                           |
| Uses listening and questioning techniques to gather information (FS4)                                               |                                           |
| Identifies any regulatory and organisational obligations relevant to presentations (KE2)                            |                                           |

### Competency conversations

Competency conversations are used to determine:

-   Why the candidate does particular activities or tasks at work
-   The candidate’s responsibilities at work
-   The candidate’s understanding of legislative and safety requirements that impact on activities or tasks at work
-   The candidate’s understanding of workplace procedures
-   Whether the candidate is able to transfer skills to other contexts and situations
-   Problem-solving skills
-   Oral communication skills
-   How they work in a team
-   More information if the portfolio didn’t entirely address the criteria and as an additional reassurance, the evidence submitted is their own work.

Oral questioning tips:

-   Keep questions short and focused on one key concept
-   Ensure that questions are formal and structured
-   Test the questions to check that they are not ambiguous
-   Use open-ended questions such as ‘what if…?’ and ‘why…?’, rather than closed questions
-   Keep questions clear and straightforward and ask one at a time
-   Link the questions to work applications
-   Use plain English
-   Look at the candidate when asking questions
-   Ensure that the candidate understands the questions
-   Ask the candidate to clarify an answer if you do not understand the response

Consider a selection of questions that are mapped to the unit of competency. Following is an example of questions for a competency conversation.

### Example competency questions

**Competency questions used to assess a candidate**

| Questions relating to unit BSBCMM401 For each question, complete the required key points (including industry requirements for that question) which need to be addressed by the student.                                                                                                                                       | Yes | No | Assessor’s comments |

| \<Type question here (text to remain black)\> **Key points:** *\<type the expected response here\>*                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |     |    |                     |

The questions selected are recorded, a judgement made on the response and assessors comments noted.

### Direct observation

A direct observation (or challenge test) is a reliable method of gathering evidence. A formal observation checklist lists the steps you would expect to see from a competent person. Below is an observations checklist.

# Assessment validation

Assessment validation is a quality review process of your RTO’s assessment system. It is a process where assessors evaluate the three critical aspects of validation:

-   Assessment Methods
-   Assessment Procedures
-   Assessment Products
-   Assessment Decisions.

## Purpose of validation

The purpose of validation is to:

-   Provide evidence for external and/or internal audits
-   Improve assessment practices
-   Confirm assessment instruments can consistently produce valid assessment judgements
-   Evaluate the quality of assessment tools
-   Provide professional development for assessors
-   Confirm the RTOs assessment systems can consistently produce valid assessment judgements
-   Determine whether different assessors/facilitators using the same tools collect the same types and levels of evidence
-   Determine whether different assessors and facilitators interpret the same evidence similarly
-   Determine whether assessment decisions reflect the rules of evidence.

In addition, the assessment validation process should highlight areas that need further attention. Depending on the focus, assessment validation should identify whether:

-   Assessment policies and procedures are effective and are being followed
-   Candidates are receiving the information they need about assessment
-   Assessment resources are properly designed
-   Assessors are assessing consistently.

## Validation approaches

Validation approaches may include:

-   Assessment panels
-   Validation and/or moderation meetings
-   Collectively developing and/or reviewing banks of assessment tools and exemplars
-   Field testing, trialling and piloting assessment tools
-   Peer review
-   Internal audit process
-   Client feedback.

The Standards for RTOs 2015 require RTOs to implement a plan of systematic validation. The Standards require these validations to review a statistically valid sample of assessments.

## When validation happens

Validation can take place at different times, with a different focus:

-   Before assessment – the design of the assessment tools are reviewed, quality of new tools are confirmed, mapping checked, and agreement reached on the standard to be achieved and the evidence to be collected.
-   During assessment – the performance of the candidate during assessment and the process of the assessment is analysed. Confirms whether different assessors using the same tools collect the same types and levels of evidence
-   After assessment – the effectiveness of the assessment is assessed. The validity of the evidence collected, the accuracy and consistency of the assessment judgement is measured and the validity of assessment practices is review. A sample of assessment evidence is used

## Preparing for validation

The most commonly used validation method involves a meeting. Generally, there will be a Lead Validator who will:

-   Organise the panel ensuring the appropriate mix of industry area expertise and training and assessment qualifications and experience
-   Send you a meeting request that indicates the purpose, context and scope of the validation
-   Provide you with the materials required for the validation

The material you will need to participate in a validation meeting will depend on the focus and approach of the assessment activity. You may need some of the following:

-   The relevant competency standards or qualifications
-   Assessment tools including assessment instruments, marking guides and mapping
-   Assessment evidence and assessment decisions
-   Assessment policies and procedures
-   Feedback from candidates
-   Validation templates and checklists.

Before a validation meeting:

-   Read through the unit of competency
-   Review the mapping - the mapping should:
    -   Cover all the unit of competency (elements, performance criteria, foundation skills, required performance and required knowledge)
    -   Indicate specifically where in the assessment/s the unit of competency criteria is being met
-   Read through the assessment instruments and marking guides. Check for errors and version control
-   Be familiar with the rules of evidence and principles of assessment.
-   Ensure you hold vocational competencies relevant to the assessment products being validated
-   Check whether you were the assessor for any evidence samples. If so, you can still participate on the panel, however you should declare this as a possible conflict of interest before the validation meeting so the chair of the meeting can manage this accordingly.

This means you will be familiar with the unit of competency and the approach taken.

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|

Refer to the topics on the Rules of Evidence and Principles of Assessment.

## Participate in the validation

You need to actively participate in the validation meeting. This will require open and honest communication. Remember someone spent considerable time writing the assessment, and you need to ensure your feedback is constructive. If you feel something is missing from the assessment or needs improvement, try to suggest ways this could be done.

The communication process used in validation will include:

-   Defining the specific needs of the team by discussing and listening
-   Brainstorming solutions without judging other team members
-   Evaluating solutions by discussing and listening to all ideas and feelings about each solution
-   Using communication skills to choose solutions that everyone can agree on and plan for.

Tasks that you will need to complete during the validation include checking that the:

-   Assessment is designed to ensure the principles of assessment can be met
-   Rules of evidence will be addressed by the assessment
-   Context and conditions of assessment are relevant to the unit and clear
-   Assessor instructions include clear guidance on decisions regarding competency that will enable consistent outcomes
-   Candidate instructions are clear
-   Assessment tools provide enough room to record feedback and information to demonstrate how the assessment decision was reached.
-   Assessment mapping is reviewed, that is, check you agree that the assessment covers the entire unit of competency, as indicated in the mapping.

### Context and conditions of assessment

Assessment tools require clear and concise candidate and assessor instructions. The validation team need to check that the context and conditions of assessment include clear instructions for the assessor and candidate and are directly related to the assessment conditions.

Some common instructions that provide context in assessments tools are:

-   The purpose of assessment
-   WHS requirements
-   The environment, for example on or off the job
-   Who will conduct the assessment
-   Quality assurance mechanisms
-   Opportunities to gather evidence in a number of situations
-   Integrated approaches
-   Contextualisation of units of competency to the candidate’s workplace
-   The period of time for assessment
-   Auspicing and partnership arrangements.

### Candidate instructions

All assessment instruments require clear and concise instructions for the candidate. The validation team will need to ensure that the candidates are given the correct instructions about the assessment process they have to follow.

This may include, but is not limited, to:

-   The timeframe for individual tasks or events
-   Reasonable adjustment considerations
-   The assessment methods
-   Opportunities for RPL
-   How they will be marked
-   How their results will be recorded
-   How they will be given feedback
-   Plagiarism
-   Resources they require to complete assessment
-   Assessment conditions
-   Evidence required to be deemed competent
-   Competency standard/benchmarks
-   Appeals process.

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|

Refer to the Assessment tools topic for more information.

Remember to review the Principles of assessment and Rules of evidence topics. They are central to validation.

## Recording validation outcomes

The outcomes of the validation must be recorded.

Generally, a validation checklist is used that lists all the validation tasks:

-   Tick whether the assessment does or does not meet the requirements
-   **Include comments.** Auditors get suspicious of a complete column of yes ticks without any justifying comments
-   Record agreed recommendations.

Make sure that it is clear who will implement the changes. It is also advisable to include a section that indicates when the changes have been finalised to ensure these recommendations have been implemented.

The RTO standards require all RTOs to keep a copy of all validation tools for a minimum of three years.

An example of a validation checklist is shown below.
